This installation guide describes how to install and configure Wazuh and Elastic Stack by first configuring their repositories.

With each new release of Wazuh or Elastic Stack, the development team at Wazuh thoroughly tests the compatibility of each component and performs necessary adjustments before releasing a new Wazuh Kibana plugin.

We recommend disabling the repositories so that the individual packages will not be updated unintentionally, which could potentially lead to having a version of the Elastic Stack for which the Wazuh integration has not been released yet.
