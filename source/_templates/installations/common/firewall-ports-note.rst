.. note::
   
   CentOS systems have a firewall enabled by default that may block communication between Wazuh components if they are spread across different hosts. Ensure that the necessary ports are open in your firewall configuration. For a complete list of required ports, refer to the :ref:`Required ports <default_ports>` section in the architecture documentation.
