#. ``hosts``: The list of Wazuh indexer nodes to connect to. You can use either IP addresses or hostnames. By default, the host is set to localhost ``hosts: ["127.0.0.1:9200"]``. Replace your Wazuh indexer IP address accordingly.

   If you have more than one Wazuh indexer node, you can separate the addresses using commas. For example, ``hosts: ["10.0.0.1:9200", "10.0.0.2:9200", "10.0.0.3:9200"]``
