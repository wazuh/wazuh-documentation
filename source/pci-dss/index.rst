Using Wazuh for PCI DSS
=======================


The **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)** is a proprietary information security standard for organizations that handle branded credit cards from the major card companies including *Visa*, *MasterCard*, *American Express*, *Discover*, and *JCB*. The standard was created to increase controls around cardholder data to reduce credit card fraud.

Wazuh helps implement PCI DSS by performing log analysis, file integrity checking, policy monitoring, intrusion detection, real-time alerting and active response. This guide explains how these capabilities assist with each of the standard requirements:
