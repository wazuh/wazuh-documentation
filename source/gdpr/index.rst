Using Wazuh for GDPR
========================

The European Union's **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** has been drawn up to agree on data privacy legislation across Europe, with the main aim of providing data protection for all citizens of the European Union. To this end, it seeks to enhance the privacy of such data and also to reform the way in which EU organizations approach data privacy. The GDPR replaces the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and was finally approved by the EU Parliament on 14 April 2016 with an implementation date set for 25 May 2018.
