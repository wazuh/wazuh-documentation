Connect the Wazuh App with the API
==================================

In this section, we'll add the Wazuh manager to the Wazuh App on Kibana.

1. Open a web browser and go to the Elastic server address, port 5601 (by default).
2. Go through the menu to the Wazuh App.
3. Click on *Add new API*.
4. Fill in the blanks with the address and the credentials of the API. The default values appear weak in the placeholders.
5. Click on *Save*.

Next steps
----------

Once the Elastic server and Wazuh manager are installed and connected, you can install and connect Wazuh agents. We hace both instruction pages to do it for :ref:`Debian/Ubuntu <wazuh_agent_deb>` and :ref:`RedHat/CentOS <wazuh_agent_rpm>`.
