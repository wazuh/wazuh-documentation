``wazuh-indexer`` packages generation guide
===========================================

The packages' generation process consists on 2 steps:

-  **Build**: compiles the Java application and bundles it into a
   package.
-  **Assembly**: uses the package from the previous step and inflates it
   with plugins and configuration files, ready for production
   deployment.

We usually generate the packages using GitHub Actions, however, the
process is designed to be independent enough for maximum portability.
GitHub Actions provides infrastructure, while the building process is
self-contained in the application code.

Each section includes instructions to generate packages locally, using
Act or Docker.

-  `Install Act <https://github.com/nektos/act>`__

The names of the packages are managed by the ``baptizer.sh`` script.

Build
-----

For local package generation, use the ``build.sh`` script. Take a look
at the ``build.yml`` workflow file for an example of usage.

::

   bash packaging_scripts/build.sh -a x64 -d tar -n $(bash packaging_scripts/baptizer.sh -a x64 -d tar -m)

Act (GitHub Workflow locally)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   act -j build -W .github/workflows/build.yml --artifact-server-path ./artifacts

Running in Docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the `Docker environment <../docker>`__:

::

   docker exec -it wi-build_$(<VERSION) bash packaging_scripts/build.sh -a {x64|arm64} -d {rpm|deb|tar}

The generated package is sent to the ``wazuh-indexer/artifacts`` folder.

Assemble
--------

**Note:** set the environment variable ``TEST=true`` to assemble a
package with the required plugins only, speeding up the assembly
process.

TAR
~~~

The assembly process for tarballs consists on:

#. Extract.
#. Install plugins.
#. Add Wazuh's configuration files and tools.
#. Compress.

::

   bash packaging_scripts/assemble.sh -a x64 -d tar -r 1

DEB
~~~

For DEB packages, the ``assemble.sh`` script will perform the following
operations:

#. Extract the deb package using ``ar`` and ``tar`` tools.

      By default, ``ar`` and ``tar`` tools expect the package to be in
      ``wazuh-indexer/artifacts/tmp/deb``. The script takes care of
      creating the required folder structure, copying also the min
      package and the Makefile.

   Current folder loadout at this stage:

   ::

      artifacts/
      |-- dist
      |   |-- wazuh-indexer-min_4.9.0_amd64.deb
      `-- tmp
          `-- deb
              |-- Makefile
              |-- data.tar.gz
              |-- debmake_install.sh
              |-- etc
              |-- usr
              |-- var
              `-- wazuh-indexer-min_4.9.0_amd64.deb

   ``usr``, ``etc`` and ``var`` folders contain ``wazuh-indexer`` files,
   extracted from ``wazuh-indexer-min-*.deb``. ``Makefile`` and the
   ``debmake_install`` are copied over from
   ``wazuh-indexer/distribution/packages/src/deb``. The
   ``wazuh-indexer-performance-analyzer.service`` file is also copied
   from the same folder. It is a dependency of the SPEC file.

#. Install the plugins using the ``opensearch-plugin`` CLI tool.

#. Set up configuration files.

      Included in ``min-package``. Default files are overwritten.

#. Bundle a DEB file with ``debmake`` and the ``Makefile``.

      ``debmake`` and other dependencies can be installed using the
      ``provision.sh`` script. The script is invoked by the GitHub
      Workflow.

Running in Docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pre-requisites:

-  Current directory: ``wazuh-indexer/``
-  Existing deb package in ``wazuh-indexer/artifacts/dist/deb``, as a
   result of the *Build* stage.
-  Using the `Docker environment <../docker>`__:

::

   docker exec -it wi-assemble_$(<VERSION) bash packaging_scripts/assemble.sh -a x64 -d deb

RPM
~~~

The ``assemble.sh`` script will use the output from the ``build.sh``
script and use it as a base to bundle together a final package
containing the plugins, the production configuration and the service
files.

The script will:

#. Extract the RPM package using ``rpm2cpio`` and ``cpio`` tools.

      By default, ``rpm2cpio`` and ``cpio`` tools expect the package to
      be in ``wazuh-indexer/artifacts/tmp/rpm``.The script takes care of
      creating the required folder structure, copying also the min
      package and the SPEC file.

   Current folder loadout at this stage:

   ::

      /rpm/$ARCH
          /etc
          /usr
          /var
          wazuh-indexer-min-*.rpm
          wazuh-indexer.rpm.spec

   ``usr``, ``etc`` and ``var`` folders contain ``wazuh-indexer`` files,
   extracted from ``wazuh-indexer-min-*.rpm``.
   ``wazuh-indexer.rpm.spec`` is copied over from
   ``wazuh-indexer/distribution/packages/src/rpm/wazuh-indexer.rpm.spec``.
   The ``wazuh-indexer-performance-analyzer.service`` file is also
   copied from the same folder. It is a dependency of the SPEC file.

#. Install the plugins using the ``opensearch-plugin`` CLI tool.

#. Set up configuration files.

      Included in ``min-package``. Default files are overwritten.

#. Bundle an RPM file with ``rpmbuild`` and the SPEC file
   ``wazuh-indexer.rpm.spec``.

      ``rpmbuild`` is part of the ``rpm`` OS package.

   ..

      ``rpmbuild`` is invoked from ``wazuh-indexer/artifacts/tmp/rpm``.
      It creates the {BUILD,RPMS,SOURCES,SRPMS,SPECS,TMP} folders and
      applies the rules in the SPEC file. If successful, ``rpmbuild``
      will generate the package in the ``RPMS/`` folder. The script will
      copy it to ``wazuh-indexer/artifacts/dist`` and clean: remove the
      ``tmp\`` folder and its contents.

   Current folder loadout at this stage:

   ::

      /rpm/$ARCH
          /{BUILD,RPMS,SOURCES,SRPMS,SPECS,TMP}
          /etc
          /usr
          /var
          wazuh-indexer-min-*.rpm

Bash scripts reference
----------------------

The packages' generation process is guided through bash scripts. This
section list and describes them, as well as their inputs and outputs.
