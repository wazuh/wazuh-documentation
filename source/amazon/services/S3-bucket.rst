AWS S3 Bucket
=============

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service used to save data to work with later. It's safe, efficient and super scalable. 
We use it to save the data flow generated by Wazuh, and we redirection this data to the rest of the services from AWS to work with them.

In this section we will see how to create this data containers:

1. Go to Services > Storage > S3:

2. Click on the *Create bucket*:

3. Create a new bucket, giving it a name and clicking on the *Create* button:

  :width: 45%

.. warning::
  Don't forget to save its Bucket ARN, it may be necessary later.
