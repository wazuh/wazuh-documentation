XDR
----

XDR (Extended Detection and Response) is a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity that analyzes data from various sources to detect, investigate, and respond to threats.

SIEM
----

SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is a platform for collecting, analyzing, and correlating security data to identify potential threats.


Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
-------------------------------

Patterns or artifacts indicating a security breach, such as IP addresses, file hashes, or network traffic patterns.

PCI DSS
-------

PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard): A set of security requirements for organizations handling cardholder data.

GDPR
----

GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation): EU regulation endpointsetting standards for personal data protection.

CIS
---

CIS (Center for Internet Security): A nonprofit organization promoting cybersecurity best practices.


HIPAA
-----

HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act): US law protecting patient health information (PHI).

NIST 800-53
-----------

NIST publication providing security controls for information systems.


Nodes
-----

An individual computer or server in a distributed system.

Cluster
-------

A group of interconnected computers or servers working together.

Agent
-----

Software program running on a node in a distributed system.


Enrollment
----------

Adding a new device or user to a managed system.

RBAC
----

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is method of assigning permissions based on a user's role.


SSO
----

SSO (Single Sign-On) is method of authenticating once to access multiple applications.

Endpoints
--------- 

A device or system connecting to a network.


Syslog
-------

A standard protocol for logging system messages.

SSH
---

SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol providing secure remote access.

RESTful
-------

REST (Representational State Transfer): Architectural style for designing web services.

API
---
API (Application Programming Interface) are rules and protocols for software communication.


Blowfish Encryption
-------------------

A symmetric encryption algorithm known for its speed and security.

MD5, SHA1, and SHA256
--------------------- 
Hashing algorithms used for password storage, file integrity verification, and digital signatures.
