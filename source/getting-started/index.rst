Getting started
===============


Wazuh is a free and open source platform used for threat prevention, detection, and response. It protects workloads across on-premises, virtualized, containerized and cloud-based environments. Wazuh is widely used by thousands of organizations around the world, from small businesses to large enterprises.

Wazuh solution consists of an :ref:`endpoint security agent <wazuh_agent>`, deployed to the monitored systems, and a :ref:`management server <wazuh_server>`, which collects and analyzes data gathered by the agents. Besides, Wazuh has been fully integrated with the :ref:`Elastic Stack <elastic_stack>`, providing a search engine and data visualization tool that allows users to navigate through their security alerts.
