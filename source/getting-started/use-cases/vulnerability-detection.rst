Vulnerability detection
=======================

Vulnerable software applications are commonly targeted by attackers to compromise endpoints and gain a persistent presence on targeted networks. Relying on its software inventory capabilities, the Wazuh platform maintains an up-to-date list of all applications installed on the endpoints where the :doc:`Wazuh agent <../components/wazuh-agent>` is located. 

In addition, Wazuh identifies vulnerable applications and produces risk reports by correlating that list with the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and with information collected from different operating system vendors. To detect vulnerable software, Wazuh uses a database of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) created automatically by processing data pulled from the following sources:

- `CVEs for Ubuntu Linux distributions <https://canonical.com>`_
- `CVEs for Red Hat and CentOS Linux distributions <https://access.redhat.com>`_
- `CVEs for Debian Linux distributions <https://www.debian.org>`_
- `CVEs for Arch Linux distributions <https://security.archlinux.org>`_
- `CVEs for Amazon Linux distributions <https://alas.aws.amazon.com/>`_
- `CVEs for SUSE Linux distributions <https://www.suse.com/support/security/oval/>`_
- `CVEs from the National Vulnerability Database <https://nvd.nist.gov/>`_
- `Microsoft Security Response Center <https://www.microsoft.com/msrc>`_

In order to enable vulnerability detection, users need to configure the :doc:`Wazuh agent <../components/wazuh-agent>` to collect software inventory data and the :doc:`Wazuh server <../components/wazuh-server>` to pull CVE information from the different vulnerability feeds. 

See below an example of a vulnerability detection alert:
