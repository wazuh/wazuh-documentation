Learning Wazuh - Kevin
======================

The applications and integrations that form the Wazuh solution represent a rich family of tools.
Getting to know these tools takes practice, so in this area we will provide you with a progressive
set of hands-on experiences to accelerate your progress towards mastery of Wazuh.  Many of the labs
will assume that the previous labs have already been completed, so we encourage you to do them in order.
