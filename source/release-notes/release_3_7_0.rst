Assigning multiple groups to an agent
-------------------------------------
One of the most relevant enhancements of this new version consists of the fact that an agent can belong to more than one group.

With this improvement, it becomes possible the idea of merging configuration of various groups, sending to the agents belonging to that multiple groups the same configuration,
composed by the configuration files of all of them.

This new functionality allows to consult all the agent's group information at the RESTfulAPI.


Query remote configuration
--------------------------
Querying for the agent's configuration in realtime is now possible. 

This queries on demand are applied to every module that can be configured at the ``ossec.conf`` file, allowing to consult information about ``syscollector``, ``local files``, ``syscheck``...


Improved performance of Syscheck
--------------------------------
The registries generated by the File Integrity Monitoring system are now stored at a new SQLite database, furthermore, they are not kept at any history of events generated, only removed, reducing the storage resources required.

Improved performance of Analysisd engine
----------------------------------------
Analysisd has been enhanced, now it is multi-threaded, being capable of processing more events.
