4.12.0 Release notes - 7 May 2025
=================================

This section lists the changes in version 4.12.0. Every update of the Wazuh solution is cumulative and includes all enhancements and fixes from previous releases.

Highlights
----------

Wazuh 4.12.0 introduces functional improvements that expand the platformâ€™s capabilities and compatibility. This release supports ARM architecture in central components, allowing Wazuh to run on a wider range of hardware. It also enhances threat intelligence by adding CTI references to the CVE data, providing better context for vulnerabilities. Additionally, it introduces eBPF support for the File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) module, enabling more efficient and modern monitoring on Linux endpoints.

-  `ARM architecture support in central components <https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/issues/26083>`__: The Wazuh manager, indexer, and dashboard now support ARM-based systems, offering greater deployment flexibility.
-  `CTI links to CVE information <https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/issues/28220>`__: Vulnerability Detection module now includes CTI references within the CVE details, offering enriched context and threat intelligence to aid in vulnerability assessment.
-  `Improved file integrity monitoring with eBPF support <https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/issues/27598>`__: The file integrity monitoring module now supports eBPF on Linux, improving who-data monitoring and system visibility.
-  `New SCA policy for Distribution Independent Linux endpoints <https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/issues/26837>`__: A new Security Configuration Assessment (SCA) policy is now available for Wazuh Linux agents.

Breaking changes
----------------

-  OpenSearch 2.19.1 and Apache Lucene upgrade: Wazuh 4.12.0 upgrades to OpenSearch 2.19.1 and updates the Apache Lucene version. This change affects compatibility with previous versions. As a result, **downgrades are not supported**. Once you upgrade the Wazuh indexer to version 4.12.0, you cannot revert to an earlier version.
