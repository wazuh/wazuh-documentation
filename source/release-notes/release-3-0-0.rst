For deploying your Wazuh environment see the :doc:`Installation guide <../installation-guide/index>`.

**New features:**

- `Grouping agents`_
- `Remote agent upgrades`_

- `Automatic decoding for JSON events`_
- `VirusTotal integration`_
- `MSI Windows installer for agents`_
- `Wazuh API`_
- `Ruleset`_
- `Updated external libraries`_
- `More relevant features`_

Grouping agents
---------------

Support for the grouping of agents has now been included at the Wazuh manager level, which makes centralized configuration more flexible and efficient.

Version 3.0.0 allows agents to be assigned to a specific group which may have different agent configuration, rootcheck policies and hardening checks than other groups. The manager will then send only the necessary files to each agent based on this assignment. Once the new configuration is received, the agent will restart itself to apply the changes.

This groups management feature is available via terminal using a CLI included in the Wazuh manager, as well using Wazuh API requests.

More information about this feature is found at :doc:`Grouping agents </user-manual/agent/agent-management/grouping-agents>`.

Remote agent upgrades
---------------------

The manager can now upgrade agents remotely.  The agent version and OS it is running on are registered with the manager. The manager uses this information to know which agents need to be upgraded and which upgrade package to send.

A custom procedure has been created to perform these upgrades without relying on external package managers (apt/yum). The manager will instead
send a compressed and signed WPK (Wazuh Signed Package) that contains the necessary binaries and instructions to upgrade the agent.

The ability to roll back the upgrade is built into the process. If the agent loses connection with the manager after the upgrade, the agent will automatically be rolled back to recover the agent connectivity.

WPK files will be generated by Wazuh for every new release. You may also use your own custom WPK files.

In our dedicated section for :doc:`Remote upgrading </user-manual/agent/agent-management/remote-upgrading/index>`, you can find more information about this procedure.

Wazuh cluster for managers
--------------------------

The Wazuh cluster provides new capability to scale Wazuh horizontally by adding as many manager nodes as needed to process events from the reporting agents.

The cluster architecture is master/client based, synchronizing internal configuration files (agent keys, groups configuration, agents configuration and agent statuses) between all clients nodes.  This allows agents to report to multiple managers (cluster nodes) which increases availability and fault tolerance.

More information on this new functionality can be found in the dedicated section at :doc:`Cluster basics </user-manual/wazuh-server-cluster/index>`.

Automatic decoding for JSON events
----------------------------------

The Wazuh manager now includes a native decoder for the JSON format which can read any JSON event and extract its fields dynamically. This new decoder enables Wazuh to use all JSON fields/values for creating rules.

See the :doc:`JSON decoder <../user-manual/ruleset/decoders/json-decoder>` section for further information.

Along with this, we introduced a new log format in Logcollector to be able to monitor JSON log files. Custom labels can be included from the endpoint which will add valuable metadata to the monitored JSON logs.

See below for sample configuration:

.. code-block:: xml

    <localfile>
      <location>/var/log/myapp/log.json</location>
      <log_format>json</log_format>
      <label key="@source">myapp</label>
      <label key="agent.type">webserver</label>
    </localfile>

Below is a sample JSON log from the monitored file.

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "event": {
      "type": "write",
      "destination": "sample.txt"
    },
    "agent": {
      "name": "web01"
    }
  }

The following will be the result when the above configuration is applied to the JSON log:

.. code-block:: json
  :class: output

  {
    "event": {
      "type": "write",
      "destination": "sample.txt"
    },
    "agent": {
      "name": "web01",
      "type": "webserver"
    },
    "@source": "myapp"
  }

Information on how to configure this feature can be found in the :doc:`localfile section <../user-manual/reference/ossec-conf/localfile>` of ``ossec.conf``.

VirusTotal Integration
-----------------------

This new version includes an integration with the VirusTotal platform.

This allows the Manager to send the hashes of collected files (via Syscheck) to the VirusTotal API, reporting back the scan results and generating an alert when there is a positive result.

The integration with VirusTotal as a threat intelligence source, along with the existing FIM capabilities is a significant improvement in Wazuh's malware detection.

Below is an example of an alert triggered from a positive result:

.. code-block:: none
   :emphasize-lines: 3
   :class: output

   ** Alert 1510684984.55826: mail  - virustotal,

The complete documentation of this integration is located at :doc:`VirusTotal integration section </user-manual/capabilities/malware-detection/virus-total-integration>`.

MSI Windows installer for agents
--------------------------------

A new digitally signed MSI Windows installer has been developed in order to improve the installation process for Windows agents.

This installer can be launched in unattended mode from the command line and combines the agent installation, configuration, registration and connection into a single step.

The procedure for using the MSI installer can be found at: :doc:`Install Wazuh agent on Windows </installation-guide/wazuh-agent/wazuh-agent-package-windows>`
