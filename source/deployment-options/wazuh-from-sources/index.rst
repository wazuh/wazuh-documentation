Installation from sources
=========================

Installing from sources gives you more control over how Wazuh is deployed. You can customize build options and target operating systems that are not covered in existing packages.

Benefits of installing from sources
-----------------------------------

-  More control over compiler, libraries, and paths.
-  Ability to apply local patches or custom build flags.

The Wazuh manager and agent can be installed via sources as an alternative to the installation from packages:
