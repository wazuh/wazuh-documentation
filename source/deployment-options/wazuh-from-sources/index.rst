Installation from sources
=========================

Installing from sources gives you full control over how Wazuh is built and installed. You can customize build options and target operating systems that are not covered in existing packages.

Benefits of installing from sources
-----------------------------------

-  Maximum control over compiler, libraries, and paths.
-  Ability to apply local patches or custom build flags.
-  Support for platforms or versions without packages.

The Wazuh manager and agent can be installed via sources as an alternative to the installation from packages:
