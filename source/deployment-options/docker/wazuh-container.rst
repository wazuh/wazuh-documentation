   :description: Wazuh supports the deployment of the central components on Docker. Learn more in this section of the documentation.

Wazuh Docker deployment
=======================

Wazuh consists of a multi-platform Wazuh agent and three central components: the Wazuh server, the Wazuh indexer, and the Wazuh dashboard. Refer to the :doc:`Wazuh components </getting-started/components/index>` documentation for more information.

Deployment options
------------------

Wazuh supports the deployment of its central components and agent on Docker.

-  :ref:`Single-node stack <single-node-stack>`: This stack deploys one of each Wazuh central component as a separate container. It includes:

   -  Wazuh indexer container: Stores and indexes security data collected by the Wazuh manager.
   -  Wazuh manager container: Analyzes collected security events, applies detection rules, and manages Wazuh agents.
   -  Wazuh dashboard container: Centralized web interface for monitoring, searching, and managing Wazuh.

   It provides persistent storage and configurable certificates for secure communication.

-  :ref:`Multi-node stack <multi-node-stack>`: This stack deploys each Wazuh component as a separate container. It includes:

   -  Three Wazuh indexer containers: Work together in a cluster to store and replicate indexed data, ensuring scalability and fault tolerance.
   -  Two Wazuh manager containers: One master and one worker node. The master coordinates agent management and rule updates, while the worker provides redundancy and load distribution.
   -  One Wazuh dashboard container.
   -  One Nginx proxy container: This provides a single secure entry point that load balances traffic between multiple Wazuh manager nodes for high availability. The Nginx container acts as a reverse proxy, distributing incoming requests across the available manager nodes and providing SSL termination for secure communication.

This deployment stack provides persistent storage, secure communication, and high availability.

-  `Wazuh agent`_: This deploys the Wazuh agent as a container on your Docker host.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before deploying Wazuh on Docker, ensure your environment meets the following requirements.

System requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Single-node stack deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Operating system**: Linux or Windows
-  **Architecture**: AMD64
-  **CPU**: At least 4 cores
-  **Memory**: At least 8 GB of RAM for the Docker host
-  **Disk space**: At least 50 GB storage for Docker images and data volumes

Multi-node stack deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Operating system**: Linux or Windows
-  **Architecture**: AMD64
-  **CPU**: At least 4 cores
-  **Memory**: At least 16 GB for the Docker host
-  **Disk space**: At least 100 GB storage for Docker images and data volumes

Wazuh agent deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Operating system**: Linux or Windows
-  **Architecture**: AMD64
-  **CPU**: At least 2 cores
-  **Memory**: At least 1 GB of RAM for the Docker host
-  **Disk space**: At least 10 GB storage for Docker images and logs

Required software
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **Docker Engine / Docker Desktop**: Use the latest stable version.

   -  **Linux**: Docker Engine

   -  **Windows**: Docker Desktop (requires WSL 2)

-  **Docker Compose**: Latest stable version (included with Docker Desktop on Windows; install separately on Linux if needed).

-  **Git**: For cloning the Wazuh Docker repository.

Linux/Unix host requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Additional configuration is required to ensure proper functionality when running Wazuh Docker on a Linux/Unix operating system.

#. Run the following command to set the ``max_map_count`` on your Docker host to ``262144``. The Wazuh indexer creates a large number of virtual memory-mapped areas (VMAs), so the kernel must be configured above the Linux default limit of ``65530``. A VMA is a region of memory that the kernel reserves to let applications like the Wazuh indexer access files directly from disk as if they were in RAM.

   .. code-block:: console

      # sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144

   .. warning::

      This configuration allows more files and index segments to be mapped to memory simultaneously without errors or crashes. If you don't set a minimum value of at least ``262144`` for ``max_map_count`` on your Linux host, the Wazuh indexer will not work correctly.

#. If you want to use Docker as a non-root user, you should add your user to the ``docker`` group using the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      # usermod -aG docker <USER>

   Replace ``<USER>`` with your username.  Log out and back in for changes to take effect.

Exposed ports
-------------

The following ports are exposed when the Wazuh central components are deployed.

+-----------+-----------------------------+
| **Port**  | **Component**               |

+-----------+-----------------------------+

Wazuh central components
------------------------

Below are the steps for deploying the Wazuh central components in :ref:`single-node <single-node-stack>` and :ref:`multi-node <multi-node-stack>` stacks.

.. warning::

   Do not run the single-node and multi-node stacks at the same time on the same Docker host. Both stacks use overlapping resources (such as container names, ports, and volumes), which can lead to conflicts, unexpected behavior, or data corruption.

.. _single-node-stack:

Single-node stack deployment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Follow the steps below to deploy the Wazuh central components in a single-node stack.

.. note::

   All deployment commands provided apply to both Windows and Linux environments.

Cloning the repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Clone the `Wazuh Docker repository <https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-docker>`__ to your system:

   .. code-block:: console

      # git clone https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-docker.git -b v|WAZUH_CURRENT_DOCKER|

#. Navigate to the ``single-node`` directory to execute all the following commands.

   .. code-block:: console

      # cd wazuh-docker/single-node/

Certificate generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must provide certificates for each node to secure communication between them in the Wazuh stack. You have two alternatives:

-  Wazuh self-signed certificates
-  Your own certificates

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Wazuh selfâ€‘signed certificates

      You must use the ``wazuh-certs-generator`` Docker image to generate self-signed certificates for each node of the stack.

      #. **Optional**: Add the following to the ``generate-indexer-certs.yml`` file if your system uses a proxy. If not, skip this step. Replace ``<YOUR_PROXY_ADDRESS_OR_DNS>`` with your proxy information.

         .. code-block:: yaml
            :emphasize-lines: 9,10

            # Wazuh App Copyright (C) 2017, Wazuh Inc. (License GPLv2)
            services:
              generator:
                image: wazuh/wazuh-certs-generator:0.0.2
                hostname: wazuh-certs-generator
                volumes:
                  - ./config/wazuh_indexer_ssl_certs/:/certificates/
                  - ./config/certs.yml:/config/certs.yml
                environment:
                  - HTTP_PROXY=<YOUR_PROXY_ADDRESS_OR_DNS>

      #. Run the following command to generate the desired certificates:

         .. code-block:: console

            # docker compose -f generate-indexer-certs.yml run --rm generator

      The generated certificates will be stored in the ``wazuh-docker/single-node/config/wazuh_indexer_ssl_certs`` directory.

   .. group-tab:: Your own certificates

      If you already have valid certificates for each node, place them in the ``wazuh-docker/single-node/config/wazuh_indexer_ssl_certs/`` directory using the following file names. Note your stack for the right path.

      **Wazuh indexer**:

      .. code-block:: none

         wazuh-docker/single-node/config/wazuh_indexer_ssl_certs/root-ca.pem
         wazuh-docker/single-node/config/wazuh_indexer_ssl_certs/wazuh.indexer-key.pem
         wazuh-docker/single-node/config/wazuh_indexer_ssl_certs/wazuh.indexer.pem
         wazuh-docker/single-node/config/wazuh_indexer_ssl_certs/admin.pem
         wazuh-docker/single-node/config/wazuh_indexer_ssl_certs/admin-key.pem

      **Wazuh manager**:

      .. code-block:: none

         wazuh-docker/single-node/config/wazuh_indexer_ssl_certs/root-ca-manager.pem
         wazuh-docker/single-node/config/wazuh_indexer_ssl_certs/wazuh.manager.pem
         wazuh-docker/single-node/config/wazuh_indexer_ssl_certs/wazuh.manager-key.pem

      **Wazuh dashboard**:

      .. code-block:: none

         wazuh-docker/single-node/config/wazuh_indexer_ssl_certs/wazuh.dashboard.pem
         wazuh-docker/single-node/config/wazuh_indexer_ssl_certs/wazuh.dashboard-key.pem
         wazuh-docker/single-node/config/wazuh_indexer_ssl_certs/root-ca.pem

Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~

#. Start the Wazuh Docker deployment using the ``docker compose`` command:

   .. tabs::

      .. group-tab:: Background

         .. code-block:: console

            # docker compose up -d

      .. group-tab:: Foreground

         .. code-block:: console

            # docker compose up

.. note::

   Docker does not dynamically reload the configuration. After changing a component's configuration, you need to restart the stack.



Accessing the Wazuh dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After deploying the single-node stack, you can access the Wazuh dashboard using your Docker host's IP address or localhost.

.. code-block:: none

   https://<DOCKER_HOST_IP>

.. note::

   If you use a self-signed certificate, your browser will display a warning that it cannot verify the certificate's authenticity.

This is the default username and password to access the Wazuh dashboard:

-  Username: ``admin``
-  Password: ``SecretPassword``

Refer to the :doc:`changing the default password of Wazuh users <changing-default-password>` section to learn more about additional security.

.. note::

   To determine when the Wazuh indexer is up, the Wazuh dashboard container uses ``curl`` to repeatedly send queries to the Wazuh indexer API (port 9200). You can expect to see several ``Failed to connect to Wazuh indexer port 9200`` log messages or ``Wazuh dashboard server is not ready yet`` until the Wazuh indexer is started. Then the setup process continues normally. It takes about one minute for the Wazuh indexer to start up. You can find the default Wazuh indexer credentials in the ``docker-compose.yml`` file.

.. _multi-node-stack:

Multi-node stack deployment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Follow the steps below to deploy the Wazuh central components in a multi-node stack.

.. note::

Wazuh agent
-----------

Running the Wazuh agent in a Docker container provides a lightweight option for integrations and for collecting logs via syslog, without installing the agent directly on a host. However, when deployed this way, the containerized agent cannot directly access or monitor the host system.

.. _agent_deployment_docker:

Deployment
^^^^^^^^^^

Follow these steps to deploy the Wazuh agent using Docker.

#. Clone the `Wazuh Docker repository <https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-docker>`_ to your system:

   .. code-block:: console

      # git clone https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-docker.git -b v|WAZUH_CURRENT_DOCKER|

#. Navigate to the ``wazuh-docker/wazuh-agent/`` directory within your repository:

   .. code-block:: console

      # cd wazuh-docker/wazuh-agent

#. Edit the ``docker-compose.yml`` file. Replace ``<YOUR_WAZUH_MANAGER_IP>`` with the IP address of your Wazuh manager. Locate the environment section for the agent service and update it:

   .. code-block:: yaml
      :emphasize-lines: 6,7

      # Wazuh App Copyright (C) 2017, Wazuh Inc. (License GPLv2)
      services:
        wazuh.agent:
          image: wazuh/wazuh-agent:|WAZUH_CURRENT_DOCKER|
          restart: always
          environment:
            - WAZUH_MANAGER_SERVER=<WAZUH_MANAGER_IP>
          volumes:
            - ./config/wazuh-agent-conf:/wazuh-config-mount/etc/ossec.conf

#. Start the Wazuh agent deployment using ``docker compose``:

   .. tabs::

      .. group-tab:: Background

         .. code-block:: console

            # docker compose up -d

      .. group-tab:: Foreground

         .. code-block:: console

            # docker compose up

#. Verify from your Wazuh dashboard that the Wazuh agent deployment was successful and visible. Navigate to the **Agent management** > **Summary**, and you should see the Wazuh agent container active on your dashboard.
