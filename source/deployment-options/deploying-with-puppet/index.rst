Deployment with Puppet
======================

Puppet is an open source software that automatically inspects, delivers, operates, and future-proofs all of your software, no matter where it is executed. It runs on many Unix-like systems as well as Microsoft Windows and includes its own declarative language to describe system configuration. It gives an alternative to install and configure Wazuh.
