Puppet is an open-source software tool that gives you an automatic way to inspect, deliver, operate and future-proof all of your software, no matter where it is executed. It runs on many Unix-like systems as well as on Microsoft Windows, and includes its own declarative language to describe system configuration. It is very simple to use and allows you to install and configure Wazuh easily.
