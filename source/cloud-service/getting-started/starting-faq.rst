How can I get support?

Where is Wazuh Cloud hosted?
----------------------------

Wazuh Cloud is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

What is a profile?
------------------

A profile refers to predefined settings available for configuring your Wazuh Cloud environment. We offer three profiles: Small, Medium, and Large. They provide ready-to-use environment templates that cater to different needs and requirements. If none of these predefined profiles meet your specific requirements, you can configure your settings individually.

What is a setting?
------------------

In the context of Wazuh Cloud, a setting refers to each configuration option available for a cloud environment. These settings determine the limitations and functionalities of an environment. For example, the "Active Agents" setting specifies the maximum number of active agents allowed in your environment. Note that the settings chosen for an environment directly impact its pricing, as they affect the resources allocated and functionalities available.

What is the indexed data?
-------------------------

The indexed data, previously known as hot storage, includes the data available on the Wazuh dashboard, which corresponds to the information Wazuh indexed. This information becomes searchable and analyzable as soon as Wazuh ingests and indexes the events sent by the agents.

What is the archive data?
--------------------------

The data generated by Wazuh is archived in an AWS S3 bucket for long-term storage purposes. Unlike the indexed data, this archive data is not searchable or analyzable. It simply consists of a collection of compressed files. For more information, please see the :ref:`Archive data <cloud_settings_archive_data>` section.

What is a tier?
---------------

The concept of a tier, which represents the size limitation, in bytes, of the indexed data (formerly known as hot storage), is no longer used. It has been replaced by the *indexed data capacity* setting.

What happens if the tier limit is reached?
------------------------------------------

See :ref:`cloud_starting_faq_data_reached`.

.. _cloud_starting_faq_data_reached:

What happens if the indexed data capacity setting is reached?
-------------------------------------------------------------

When the selected indexed data capacity is reached, the oldest events will be automatically removed from your index regardless of the index data time. This data is available in archive data for you to access. See the Archive data section to learn more about data logging and storage.

How is indexed data rotated?
----------------------------

Data rotation is determined by two conditions: the indexed data retention and the indexed data capacity. For instance, if you have set a 3-month indexed data retention and a 100GB indexed data capacity, and you consume the entire 100GB within the first month, the data will start rotating. Similarly, even if you have not utilized all 100GB, the data from the first month will be rotated by the fourth month if only 20GB is used.

What happens if the average/peak EPS is exceeded?
----------------------------------------------------

If the number of events per second (EPS) exceeds the allowed average/peak limit, events start queueing. Once the queue is full, new events are discarded. The queue and buffer settings are located in the :ref:`internal options for analysisd <ossec_internal_analysisd>`. New releases might change the default values to maintain optimal performance and improve service.

Can I increase the average/peak EPS
-----------------------------------

See :ref:`Adjusting environment settings <cloud_settings_adjust>`.

Can I cancel at any time?
-------------------------

Yes, you can cancel at any time with no penalty. You can keep using your environment until the end of your :doc:`current billing cycle </cloud-service/account-billing/billing-history>`, and no future charges are incurred after this period.

How do I convert my environment from trial to production?
