Enroll agents
=============

Agent groups in Wazuh are used to organize and manage agents by grouping them based on specific criteria such as their role, location, or type of system. This allows for centralized management and tailored configuration, enabling users to apply specific rules, policies, and settings to different groups efficiently. New agents in Wazuh are automatically assigned to a default group called "default" if they are not specifically placed in another group. This default group acts as a general category, providing basic monitoring and security configurations for agents until they can be assigned to more appropriate groups based on their specific needs. Check out the `Create agents groups`_ section to learn how to create customized groups to suit your environment.
