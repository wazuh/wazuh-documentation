Edit user settings
===================

You can edit your account preferences, such as email address and password from the Wazuh Cloud Console. You can also enable multi-factor authentication to increase security and see login method alternatives.

#. Go to **User settings**.
#. Fill in or edit the fields. **Company** and **Country** are required in order to continue.
#. Click **Save** to complete the action.

Update your email address

Change your Wazuh Cloud Console password
----------------------------------------

When you signed up for a Wazuh Cloud account with your email address, you selected a password that you use to log in to the console. If needed, you can change this password.

If you know your current password:

If you don’t know your current password:

#. Click on **Forgot my password** on the login page of the Wazuh Cloud Console.
#. Enter the primary email address for your account and click **Reset password**.

  An email is sent to your address with a link to reset the password.

Enable multi-factor authentication
----------------------------------

To add an extra layer of security to your Wazuh Cloud account, you can set up a Virtual MFA Device like Google authenticator.

To enable multi-factor authentication:

#. Log in to the `Wazuh Cloud Console <https://console.cloud.wazuh.com/>`_ and click the upper-right user icon to open the menu.
#. Go to **User settings**.
#. Under Multi-factor authentication, click **Add MFA** and follow the steps described in the Set up virtual MFA device pane.
#. Click **Enable MFA** to complete the process.

  If your device is lost or stolen, contact support through the **Help** section of the Wazuh Cloud Console.
