The Wazuh Cloud Console provides web-based access to manage your Wazuh Cloud environments.

.. _cloud_glossary_cloud_id:

Cloud ID
--------

The Cloud ID is a unique ID for your environment on Wazuh Cloud. It is used for multiple purposes, such as Wazuh WUI access or the agent registration process.

.. _cloud_glossary_environment:

Environment
-----------

An environment is a deployment that contains all the Wazuh components ready to use and running on Wazuh Cloud.

.. _cloud_glossary_cold_storage:

Archived data (formerly known as cold storage)
----------------------------------------------

It is the data containing the output generated by Wazuh, such as alerts or archives. It is an AWS S3 bucket to store your logs for a longer time and meet compliance requirements.


.. _cloud_glossary_hot_storage:

Indexed data (formerly known as hot storage) 
--------------------------------------------

It is the data available on the Wazuh WUI corresponding to the information indexed by Wazuh. This information is available as soon as Wazuh ingests and indexes the events sent by the agents, making the data searchable and analyzable.

Hot storage use is calculated using the primary shards of ``wazuh-*`` indices.

.. _cloud_glossary_tier:

Tier
----

The concept of a tier, which represents the size limitation, in bytes, of the indexed data (formerly known as hot storage), is no longer used. It has been replaced by the *indexed data size* setting.

.. _cloud_glossary_setting:

Setting
-------

A setting in the context of Wazuh Cloud refers to each of the configuration options available for a cloud environment. These settings define the limitations, capabilities, and pricing of the environment.

.. _cloud_glossary_profile:

Profile
-------

A profile refers to a predefined set of settings that you can choose from when configuring your Wazuh Cloud environment. We have three profiles available: Small, Medium, and Large. These profiles are designed to simplify the process by providing preconfigured settings that cater to different needs and requirements. If none of the predefined profiles meet your specific requirements, you can configure your settings individually.

.. _cloud_glossary_region:

Region
------

A region is a geographic area where the data center of the cloud provider that hosts your environment is located. The region you select cannot be changed after you create an environment. If you are not sure what to pick, choose a region that is geographically close to you to reduce latency.

Available regions:

* North Virginia: ``us-east-1``
  
* Ohio: ``us-east-2``

* London: ``eu-west-2``
