Concepts
--------

**Cloud Console**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The interface that provides access to your account, environment, help, and billing management.

**Cloud ID**
^^^^^^^^^^^^

ID received right after an environment has been successfully created. It is used for multiple purposes such as WUI browser access or agent registration process.

.. _cloud_glossary_cold_storage:

**Cold Storage (Offline Storage)**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data containing the output generated by Wazuh such as alerts or archives, and a daily configuration backup. This data will be uploaded within 10 to 30 minutes since it was processed by Wazuh. Then, it will be :ref:`available to be downloaded<cloud_your_environment_accessing_cold_storage>` through the Wazuh Cloud API by the user. There is no size limit for this data, but alerts and archives will be removed 365 days after their creation, and so will backup files after 30 days.

**Contacts**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users within an organization that are addressed by email from an environment in order to provide billing or operational information. These contacts :ref:`can be configured separately<cloud_account_billing_update_billing>`.

.. _cloud_glossary_environment:

**Environment**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The environment is the core of Wazuh Cloud Service. It will both work as a hosted EDR to collect security data and allow its visualization. It can be conveniently adjusted to fit any system's requirements.

.. _cloud_glossary_hot_storage:

**Hot Storage (Online Storage)**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data available on the :ref:`Wazuh WUI<cloud_glossary_wui>`. It is formed by all the generated alerts from the Wazuh manager. This information is available as soon as Wazuh manager processes it and Elasticsearch indexes it, and it will remain available until you reach your tier limit. More precisely, this storage is calculated using the primary shards of ``wazuh-*`` indices in Elasticsearch.

.. _cloud_glossary_region:

**Region**
^^^^^^^^^^

An environment can be set up in different regions such as US east (N. Virginia, Ohio), Europe (London, Frankfurt) or Asia Pacific (Singapore). A region should be chosen according to user's preferences.

**RESTful API**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

API to interact with Wazuh Cloud Service. E.g. it can be used to access an environment's cold storage by using the Storage Endpoint.

.. _cloud_glossary_tier:

**Tier**
^^^^^^^^

Total size (in GB) of data from the alerts and archives which are available online through the :ref:`Web User Interface<cloud_glossary_wui>`. It matches the definition of :ref:`hot storage <cloud_glossary_hot_storage>`.

**Trial**
^^^^^^^^^

14-day period when you can try out Wazuh Cloud Service for free. Any tier is allowed. The trialing :ref:`environment <cloud_glossary_environment>`, along with all the data collected until that moment, can keep being used by adding your billing details before the trial period is over.

.. _cloud_glossary_wui:

**Web User Interface (WUI)**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wazuh Cloud Service Interface which can be used to monitor your :ref:`hot storage <cloud_glossary_hot_storage>` data and interact with your environment.
