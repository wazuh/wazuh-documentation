.. _cloud_glossary_hot_storage:

Indexed data
--------------------------------------------

Formerly known as hot storage, it's the data available on the Wazuh dashboard corresponding to the information indexed by Wazuh. This information is available as soon as Wazuh ingests and indexes the events sent by the agents, making the data searchable and analyzable.

Indexed data is calculated using the primary shards of ``wazuh-*`` indices.

A profile refers to predefined settings that you can choose from when configuring your Wazuh Cloud environment. We have three profiles available: Small, Medium, and Large.

If none of the predefined profiles meet your specific requirements, you can configure your settings individually.

.. _cloud_glossary_region:
