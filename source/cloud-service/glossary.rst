Indexed data
--------------------------------------------

Formerly known as hot storage, it's the data available on the Wazuh dashboard corresponding to the information indexed by Wazuh. This information is available as soon as Wazuh ingests and indexes the events sent by the agents, making the data searchable and analyzable.

Indexed data is calculated using the primary shards of ``wazuh-*`` indices.

A profile refers to predefined settings that you can choose from when configuring your Wazuh Cloud environment. We have three profiles available: Small, Medium, and Large. These profiles are designed to simplify the process by providing preconfigured settings that cater to different needs and requirements. If none of the predefined profiles meet your specific requirements, you can configure your settings individually.

.. _cloud_glossary_region:

A region is a geographic area where the data center of the cloud provider that hosts your environment is located. The region you select cannot be changed after you create an environment. If you are not sure what to pick, choose a region that is geographically close to you to reduce latency.
