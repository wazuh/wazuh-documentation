Wazuh AI Analyst service
========================

Overview
--------

The Wazuh AI Analyst service provides Wazuh Cloud users with insights into their security posture and offers recommendations on how to remediate threats detected within their Wazuh Cloud subscription.

This service is an automated AI-powered security analysis solution that integrates Wazuh Cloud with advanced AI models. It leverages machine learning capabilities to process security data and deliver actionable insights to help improve organizational security.

The service provides organizations with:

-  Automated security analysis without manual intervention.
-  Insights aggregated from multiple security data sources.
-  Structured recommendations to improve security posture.
-  Regular assessments of security posture through scheduled analyses.

What to expect
--------------

The service periodically sends emails and reports. You can download these reports from the Wazuh Cloud Console.

AI Analyst email
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users receive periodic emails with key performance indicators and a summary of their security posture. Each email includes:

-  A histogram showing the number of protected endpoints.
-  The volume of alerts received by the SIEM.
-  The number of active vulnerabilities.
-  A summary of the current security posture.
-  The AI Analyst Report attached as a PDF.

AI Analyst report
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The report includes AI-generated insights based on data from the user's Wazuh Cloud subscription. It contains the following sections:

-  **Overall assessment**

   A summary generated by the AI, providing an overall evaluation of the organization's security posture during the reporting period.

-  **Alert analysis**

   Wazuh analyzes log data collected across the monitored infrastructure. Each log is evaluated against predefined security rules, each tagged with a criticality level.

   This section presents alert data analysis by MITRE technique and alert level, along with a summary of recommended actions.

-  **Vulnerability analysis**

   Software vulnerabilities are weaknesses in code that attackers can exploit to gain unauthorized access or alter application behavior. Vulnerable software applications are commonly targeted by attackers to compromise endpoints and gain a persistent presence on targeted networks.

   This section includes analysis by severity, affected packages, and operating system, along with recommended mitigation actions.

-  **Endpoint analysis**

   Highlights the ten most active endpoints based on alert volume. This helps identify areas with elevated security activity.
