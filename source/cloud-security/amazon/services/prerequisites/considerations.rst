Considerations for the Wazuh module for AWS configuration
=========================================================

First execution
---------------

The Wazuh module for AWS will only fetch the AWS services logs from the date the module is first executed. If there are older logs that need to be fetched during the first execution of the module, you need to use the :ref:`only_logs_after <only_logs_aws_buckets>` option.

.. note::

   If you need to fetch older logs after the first execution of the Wazuh module for AWS, see the Reparse_ section.


Filtering
---------

If the S3 bucket contains a long history of logs and its directory structure is organized by dates, it's possible to filter which logs will be read by Wazuh. There are multiple configuration options to do so:

-  ``only_logs_after``: Allows filtering logs produced after a given date. The date format must be ``YYYY-MMM-DD``. For example, ``2018-AUG-21`` would filter logs generated on or after the 21st of August 2018.
-  ``aws_account_id``: This option will only work on CloudTrail, VPC, and Config buckets. If you have logs from multiple accounts, you can filter which ones will be read by Wazuh. You can specify multiple IDs separating them by commas.
-  ``regions``: This option will only work on CloudTrail, VPC, Config buckets, and Inspector service. If you have logs from multiple regions, you can filter which ones will be read by Wazuh. You can specify multiple regions separating them by commas. It is mandatory to specify the region when configuring an S3 bucket from an AWS GovCloud region (available GovCloud regions are ``us-gov-east-1`` and ``us-gov-west-1``).
-  ``path``: If your logs are stored in a given path in an S3 bucket, this option can be specified. For example, to read logs stored in the directory ``vpclogs/``, it is necessary to specify the path ``vpclogs`` in the Wazuh module for AWS configuration. It can also be specified with ``/`` or ``\``.
-  ``aws_organization_id``: This option will only work on CloudTrail buckets. If you have configured an organization, you need to specify the name of the AWS organization by using this parameter.

In the ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` file of the Wazuh server or agent, the configuration will be similar to this.

.. code-block:: xml

   <wodle name="aws-s3">
     <disabled>no</disabled>
     <interval>10m</interval>
     <run_on_start>yes</run_on_start>
     <skip_on_error>yes</skip_on_error>
     <!-- CloudTrail, two regions, path, account_id, organization_id and logs after January 2018 -->
     <bucket type="cloudtrail">
       <name><WAZUH_AWS_BUCKET></name>
       <aws_profile>default</aws_profile>
       <aws_account_id>123456789012</aws_account_id>
       <regions>us-east-1,us-east-2</regions>
       <path>wazuh-logs</path>
       <only_logs_after>2018-JAN-01</only_logs_after>
       <aws_organization_id>AWS-ORG-1</aws_organization_id>
     </bucket>
   </wodle>

Older logs
----------

The Wazuh module for AWS only looks for new logs in buckets based on the key of the last processed log object, which includes the datetime stamp. After the integration has processed logs, it cannot retrieve logs that are older than the processed ones, even if you respecify the :ref:`only_logs_after <only_logs_aws_buckets>` option. The logs older than the first one processed will be ignored and not ingested into Wazuh. This is true for all supported services except the ``CloudWatch Logs`` service.

On the other hand, when monitoring the ``CloudWatch Logs`` service, the Wazuh module for AWS can process logs older than the first one processed. To do so, specify an older ``only_logs_after`` value, and the Wazuh module for AWS will process all logs between the value set for ``only_logs_after`` and the first log executed without generating duplicate alerts.

In this Wazuh module for AWS configuration in ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf``, when executed for the first time, the Wazuh module for AWS will process CloudTrail logs from 1st of January 2018 till the present day. If the ``only_logs_after`` value is specified after the first execution, it will not process the older logs.

.. code-block:: xml
   :emphasize-lines: 11

   <wodle name="aws-s3">
     <disabled>no</disabled>
     <interval>10m</interval>
     <run_on_start>yes</run_on_start>
     <skip_on_error>yes</skip_on_error>
     <!-- CloudTrail, two regions, and logs after January 2018 -->
     <bucket type="cloudtrail">
       <name><WAZUH_AWS_BUCKET></name>
       <aws_profile>default</aws_profile>
       <regions>us-east-1,us-east-2</regions>
       <only_logs_after>2018-JAN-01</only_logs_after>
     </bucket>
   </wodle>

.. note::

   If you need to process older logs after the Wazuh module for AWS has been executed for the first time, see the Reparse_ section.

In this Wazuh module for AWS configuration in ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` file, regardless of when the Wazuh module for AWS is executed, it will process CloudWatch logs from 1st of January 2018 till the present day.

.. code-block:: xml
   :emphasize-lines: 10

   <wodle name="aws-s3">
     <disabled>no</disabled>
     <interval>10m</interval>
     <run_on_start>yes</run_on_start>
     <skip_on_error>yes</skip_on_error>
     <!-- CloudWatch, two regions, and logs after January 2018 -->
       <service type="cloudwatchlogs">
           <aws_profile>default</aws_profile>
           <aws_log_groups>log_group1,log_group2</aws_log_groups>
           <only_logs_after>2018-JAN-01</only_logs_after>
           <regions>us-east-1,us-west-1,eu-central-1</regions>
       </service>
   </wodle>

Reparse
-------

Using the ``reparse`` option will fetch and process every log from the starting point until the present. The ``only_logs_after`` value sets the time for the starting point. If you don't provide an ``only_logs_after`` value, the Wazuh module for AWS uses the date of the first log processed as the starting point. This process may generate duplicate alerts.

To collect and process older logs loaded into the S3 bucket, you need to run the Wazuh module for AWS manually using the ``--reparse`` option. In the example below, we manually run the Wazuh module for AWS using the ``--reparse`` option on a Wazuh server.

.. code-block:: console

   # /var/ossec/wodles/aws/aws-s3 -b 'wazuh-example-bucket' --reparse --only_logs_after '2021-Jun-10' --debug 2

The ``--debug 2`` parameter produces verbose output. This is useful to show the script is working, especially when handling a large amount of data.

.. _connection_configuration_for_retries:

Connection configuration for retries
------------------------------------

Some calls to AWS services may fail when made in highly congested environments. The :ref:`AWS pip dependencies <boto-3>` client raises *ClientError* exceptions describing the errors. This kind of exception often needs repeating the call, without further handling. To help retry these calls, Boto3 provides retries. This feature allows retrying client calls to AWS services when you experience errors like ``ThrottlingException``.

Users can customize two retry configurations.

-  ``retry_mode``: legacy, standard, and adaptive.

   -  **Legacy** mode is the default retry mode. It sets the older version 1 for the retry handler. This includes:

      -  Retry attempts for a limited number of errors/exceptions.
      -  A default value of 5 for maximum call attempts.

   -  **Standard** mode sets the updated version 2 for the retry handler. It includes:

      -  Extended functionality over that found in the legacy mode where retry attempts apply to an expanded list of errors/exceptions.
      -  A default value of 3 for maximum call attempts.

   -  **Adaptive** mode is an experimental retry mode. It includes all the features of the standard mode. This mode offers flexibility in client-side retries. Retries adapt to the error/exception state response from an AWS service.

-  ``max_attempts``: The maximum number of attempts including the initial call. This configuration can override the default value set by the retry mode.

You can specify the retry configuration in the ``/root/.aws/config`` `configuration file <https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html#using-a-configuration-file>`__. The profile section must include the ``max_attempts``, ``retry_mode``, and ``region`` settings.

It is important to use the same profile as the one you chose as your :ref:`authentication method profile <aws_profile>`. If the authentication method lacks a profile, then the ``[Default]`` profile must include the configurations. If the configuration file is missing, the Wazuh module for AWS defines the following values by default:

-  ``retry_mode=standard``
-  ``max_attempts=10``

The following example of a ``/root/.aws/config`` file sets retry parameters for the dev profile:

.. code-block:: ini

   [profile dev]
   region=us-east-1
   max_attempts=5
   retry_mode=standard

Additional configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wazuh supports additional configuration options found in the ``/root/.aws/config`` file. The supported keys are the primary keys stated in the `Boto3 configuration <https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html>`__. Supported keys are:

-  region_name
-  signature_version
-  s3
-  proxies
-  proxies_config
-  retries

The following example of a ``/root/.aws/config`` file sets the supported configuration for the dev profile:

.. code-block:: ini

   [profile dev]
   region = us-east-1
   output = json
   max_attempts = 5
   retry_mode = standard

   s3.max_concurrent_requests = 10
   s3.max_queue_size = 1000
   s3.multipart_threshold = 64MB
   s3.multipart_chunksize = 16MB
   s3.max_bandwidth = 50MB/s
   s3.use_accelerate_endpoint = true
   s3.addressing_style = virtual

   proxy.host = proxy.example.com
   proxy.port = 8080
   proxy.username = your-proxy-username
   proxy.password = your-proxy-password

   proxy.ca_bundle = /path/to/ca_bundle.pem
   proxy.client_cert = /path/to/client_cert.pem
   proxy.use_forwarding_for_https = true

   signature_version = s3v4

To configure multiple profiles for the integration, declare each profile section in ``/root/.aws/config`` with ``[profile <PROFILE_NAME>]``. If you don't declare a profile section in this configuration file, Wazuh uses the ``default`` profile.

Configuring multiple services
-----------------------------

Below is an example of different AWS services configuration:

.. code-block:: xml

   <wodle name="aws-s3">
     <disabled>no</disabled>
     <interval>10m</interval>
     <run_on_start>yes</run_on_start>
     <skip_on_error>yes</skip_on_error>

     <!-- Inspector, two regions, and logs after January 2018 -->
     <service type="inspector">
       <aws_profile>default</aws_profile>
       <regions>us-east-1,us-east-2</regions>
       <only_logs_after>2018-JAN-01</only_logs_after>
     </service>

     <!-- GuardDuty, 'production' profile -->
     <bucket type="guardduty">
       <name><WAZUH_AWS_BUCKET></name>
       <path>guardduty</path>
       <aws_profile>production</aws_profile>
     </bucket>

     <!-- Config, 'default' profile -->
     <bucket type="config">
       <name><WAZUH_AWS_BUCKET></name>
       <path>config</path>
       <aws_profile>default</aws_profile>
     </bucket>

     <!-- KMS, 'dev' profile -->
     <bucket type="custom">
       <name><WAZUH_AWS_BUCKET></name>
       <path>kms_compress_encrypted</path>
       <aws_profile>dev</aws_profile>
     </bucket>

     <!-- CloudTrail, 'default' profile, without 'path' tag -->
     <bucket type="cloudtrail">
       <name><WAZUH_CLOUDTRAIL></name>
       <aws_profile>default</aws_profile>
     </bucket>

     <!-- CloudTrail, 'gov1' profile, and 'us-gov-east-1' GovCloud region -->
     <bucket type="cloudtrail">
       <name><WAZUH_AWS_BUCKET></name>
       <path>cloudtrail-govcloud</path>
       <regions>us-gov-east-1</regions>
       <aws_profile>gov1</aws_profile>
     </bucket>

     <!-- CloudTrail, 'gov2' profile, and 'us-gov-west-1' GovCloud region -->
     <bucket type="cloudtrail">
       <name><WAZUH_AWS_BUCKET></name>
       <path>cloudtrail-govcloud</path>
       <regions>us-gov-west-1</regions>
       <aws_profile>gov2</aws_profile>
     </bucket>

   </wodle>

Where:

-  ``<disabled>`` enables or disables the Wazuh module for AWS.
-  ``<interval>`` is the time interval between module execution.
-  ``<run_on_start>`` execute the Wazuh module for AWS immediately after the Wazuh service starts.
-  ``<skip_on_error>`` skip a log with an error and continue processing other logs.
-  ``<service type>`` indicates the service configured. The available types are ``cloudwatchlogs``, and ``inspector``.
-  ``<aws_profile>`` a valid profile name from the AWS credential file or config file with permission to access the service.
-  ``<regions>`` a comma-separated list of regions to limit parsing of logs.

.. _using_non-default_aws_endpoints:

Using VPC and FIPS endpoints
----------------------------

In AWS, a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It provides an isolated environment where you can launch AWS resources such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, and more.

FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) endpoints in AWS refer to endpoints that enforce FIPS 140-2 compliance for cryptographic modules. When you enable a FIPS endpoint, AWS ensures that any cryptographic operations performed by the endpoint use FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic libraries.

Learn how to integrate the Wazuh module for AWS with VPC and FIPS endpoints.

VPC endpoints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

VPC endpoints reduce VPC traffic costs by enabling direct connections to supported AWS services, eliminating the need for public IPs.

The Wazuh module for AWS can pull logs from an AWS S3 bucket regardless of the service the logs originate from. Wazuh can utilize VPC endpoints for this purpose if it is running within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). The same applies to the other AWS services the Wazuh module for AWS supports, such as CloudWatchLogs, provided that they are compatible with VPC endpoints. The list of AWS services supporting VPC endpoints can be checked `here <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/integrated-services-vpce-list.html>`__.

Configure the ``service_endpoint`` and ``sts_endpoint`` tags in the ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` file. This specifies the VPC endpoint URL for obtaining the data and for logging into STS when an IAM role was specified, respectively.

The following is an example of a valid configuration:

.. code-block:: xml
   :emphasize-lines: 10,17,18,25

   <wodle name="aws-s3">
     <disabled>no</disabled>
     <interval>10m</interval>
     <run_on_start>yes</run_on_start>
     <skip_on_error>yes</skip_on_error>

     <bucket type="cloudtrail">
       <name><WAZUH_CLOUDTRAIL></name>
       <aws_profile>default</aws_profile>
       <service_endpoint>https://bucket.xxxxxx.s3.us-east-2.vpce.amazonaws.com</service_endpoint>
     </bucket>

     <bucket type="cloudtrail">
       <name>wazuh-cloudtrail-2</name>
       <aws_profile>default</aws_profile>
       <iam_role_arn>arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxx:role/wazuh-role</iam_role_arn>
       <sts_endpoint>xxxxxx.sts.us-east-2.vpce.amazonaws.com</sts_endpoint>
       <service_endpoint>https://bucket.xxxxxx.s3.us-east-2.vpce.amazonaws.com</service_endpoint>
     </bucket>

     <service type="cloudwatchlogs">
       <aws_profile>default</aws_profile>
       <regions>us-east-2</regions>
       <aws_log_groups>log_group_name</aws_log_groups>
       <service_endpoint>https://xxxxxx.logs.us-east-2.vpce.amazonaws.com</service_endpoint>
     </service>

   </wodle>

FIPS endpoints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wazuh supports the use of AWS FIPS endpoints to comply with the `Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2 <https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/140/2/final>`__. Depending on the service and region of choice, a different endpoint must be selected from the `AWS FIPS endpoints list <https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fips/>`__. Specify the selected endpoint in the ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` file using the ``service_endpoint`` tag.

The following is an example of a valid configuration.
