Configuring an S3 Bucket
========================

.. note::
  All the supported services except ``Inspector`` need a bucket for working. It is not necessary to create a bucket for each service.

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that delivers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

We use it to save the data flow generated by Wazuh, and we redirect this data to the rest of the services from AWS to work with them.

In this section we will see how to create these data containers:

1. Go to Services > Storage > S3:

2. Click on *Create bucket*:

      :align: center
      :width: 70%

3. Create a new bucket, give it a name, then click on the *Create* button:

      :align: center
      :width: 45%

    .. warning::
      Note down the bucket ARN because it might be needed later.
