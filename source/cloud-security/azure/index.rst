- Monitoring the Azure Portal and its services, including platform logs from Azure services, logs, performance data from virtual machines, and usage and performance data from the applications.
- Monitoring the Microsoft Entra ID (ME-ID) activity to discover how the Microsoft Entra ID services are accessed and used.
