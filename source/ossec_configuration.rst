OSSEC basic configuration
=========================

In this documentation you will find the instructions to add a new agent, and to configure it to report to your OSSEC manager. For detailed information on OSSEC HIDS configuration options, please go to the `project documentation <http://ossec.github.io/docs/>`_, or the `reference manual <http://ossec.github.io/docs/manual/index.html>`_.

Add a new agent
---------------

On your OSSEC manager, run  ``/var/ossec/bin/manage_agents``: ::

   $ /var/ossec/bin/manage_agents

You will then be presented the options shown below. Choose "A" to add an agent": ::

   ****************************************
   * OSSEC HIDS v2.8 Agent manager.     *
   * The following options are available: *
   ****************************************
      (A)dd an agent (A).
      (E)xtract key for an agent (E).
      (L)ist already added agents (L).
      (R)emove an agent (R).
      (Q)uit.
   Choose your action: A,E,L,R or Q: A

You need to type a name for the agent, an IP address and an ID: ::

   - Adding a new agent (use '\q' to return to the main menu).
     Please provide the following:
      * A name for the new agent: agent-name
      * The IP Address of the new agent: 10.0.0.1
      * An ID for the new agent[001]:
   Agent information:
      ID:001
      Name:agent-name
      IP Address:10.0.0.1

   Confirm adding it?(y/n): y

.. note:: The agent IP address should always match the one the agent will be connected from. If unsure you can use ``any``. As well you could inspect your network traffic with ``tcpdump``, to see IP headers of incoming packets.

Now you have to extract the agent's key, which will be displayed on the screen. See below an example: ::

   ****************************************
   * OSSEC HIDS v2.8 Agent manager.       *
   * The following options are available: *
   ****************************************
      (A)dd an agent (A).
      (E)xtract key for an agent (E).
      (L)ist already added agents (L).
      (R)emove an agent (R).
      (Q)uit.
   Choose your action: A,E,L,R or Q:e
   
   Available agents: 
   ID: 001, Name: agent-name, IP: 10.0.0.1
   Provide the ID of the agent to extract the key (or '\q' to quit): 001

   Agent key information for '001' is: 
   MDAxIFRlc3RBZ2V0biAxMTEuMTExLjExMS4xMTEgY2MxZjA1Y2UxNWQyNzEyNjdlMmE3MTRlODI0MTA1YTgxNTM5ZDliN2U2ZDQ5MWYxYzBkOTU4MjRmNjU3ZmI2Zg==

   ** Press ENTER to return to the main menu.

Now copy the key (the whole line ending in ``==``), because you'll have to import it at the agent.

Agent configuration on Linux
----------------------------

Your agent needs to have the IP address of your manager, in order to know where to send the data. Please check your agent configuration file, which is located at ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf``, and set the ``server-ip`` to the right value: ::

   <ossec_config>
     <client>
       <server-ip>XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX</server-ip>
     </client>

Now you can run ``manage_agents`` (remember we are on your agent system, not on the manager), and paste the previously copied key: ::

   $ /var/ossec/bin/manage_agents

   ****************************************
   * OSSEC HIDS v2.8 Agent manager.       *
   * The following options are available: *
   ****************************************
      (I)mport key from the server (I).
      (Q)uit.
   Choose your action: I or Q: I

   * Provide the Key generated by the server.
   * The best approach is to cut and paste it.
   *** OBS: Do not include spaces or new lines.

   Paste it here (or '\q' to quit): MDAxIFRlc3RBZ2V0biAxMTEuMTExLjExMS4xMTEgY2MxZjA1Y2UxNWQyNzEyNjdlMmE3MTRlODI0MTA1YTgxNTM5ZDliN2U2ZDQ5MWYxYzBkOTU4MjRmNjU3ZmI2Zg==

   Agent information:
      ID:001
      Name:agent-name
      IP Address:10.0.0.1

   Confirm adding it?(y/n): y

Now your agent have been properly added. You can restart it running: ::

   $ /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control restart
