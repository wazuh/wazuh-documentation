Elasticsearch cluster
=====================

The Elastic Stack can be installed as a single-node cluster or as a multi-node cluster. The single-node installation is performed on only one host, where Open Distro for Elasticsearch is installed. The multi-node installation process consists of installing several Elastic Stack nodes on different hosts that communicate among them. This kind of installation provides high availability and load balancing.
