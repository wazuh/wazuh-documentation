# How to install a manager on Mac for test purposes:

In Mac, just the wazuh agent can be installed. However, a Wazuh manager to whom the Wazuh agent would report is necessary.
Thus for the test purposes, installing a Virtual Machine such as Virtual Box is a solution.

* To install VirtualBox for Mac, please follow steps in the link <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>

* Once installed VirtualBox, importing a virtual image (OVA) that contains a wazuh manager along with the ELK . 
The user can find this image in : <https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/virtual-machine.html>

* In File->Import, import the OVA in your virtualization platform and run the virtual machine. 
The wazuh-server login "root" and the password "wazuh"

* In the following path, /var/ossec/etc/ assure that there are the certificate <sslmanager.cert> and the key <sslmanager.key>

* In /var/ossec/bin/ run the following ./ossec-authd to start the authd server in the Manager

* Run ifconfig and get the server's IP

* Include the server's ip in etc/conf of the agent side

* in bin of agent's side  ./ossec-control restart

*
