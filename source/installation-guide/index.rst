Installation guide
========================

This document will guide you through the installation process. For interactive help, our `email forum <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/wazuh>`_ is available.  You can subscribe by sending an email to ``wazuh+subscribe@googlegroups.com``.

Wazuh installation involves two central components, the Wazuh server and Elastic Stack. In addition, Wazuh agents will be deployed to the monitored hosts in your environment:

- **Wazuh server:** Runs the Wazuh manager, API and Filebeat (only necessary in distributed architecture). Collects and analyzes data from deployed agents.

+ **Elastic Stack**: Runs the Elasticsearch engine, Logstash server and Kibana (including the Wazuh App). It reads, parses, indexes and stores alert data generated by the Wazuh server.

- **Wazuh agent**: Runs on the monitored host, collecting system log and configuration data, and detecting intrusions and anomalies. It talks to the Wazuh server, to which it forwards collected data for further analysis.

Distributed architectures do run the Wazuh server and Elastic Stack cluster (one or more servers) in different hosts. On the other hand, single-host architectures do have  Wazuh server and Elastic Stack installed in the same system. This guide covers both distributed and single-host architectures. 

The diagrams below list the components that are run per host, both for single-host and distributed architectures.

.. note::
	Before installing the components please confirm time synchronization is configured and working on your servers. This is most commonly done with **NTP**.  More info for `Debian/Ubuntu <https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/NTP.html>`_ and `CentOS/RHEL/Fedora <http://www.tecmint.com/install-ntp-server-in-centos/>`_.
