  :description: Find useful technical documentation about how Wazuh works, suitable for developers and tech enthusiasts.

An All-in-One installation guide is included in the :ref:`Installation guide section<all_in_one>`, which aims to introduce Wazuh by installing it along with Elastic Stack on a single system (server). The all-in-one installation lacks of the high availability and scalability capabilities of a distributed environment.

This section however, will explain how to build a production environment with data and services high availability, scalability, etc. The introduction document will go through the basic concepts and architecture of a Wazuh production environment.
