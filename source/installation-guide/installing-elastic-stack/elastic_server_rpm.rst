Install Elastic Stack with RPM packages
=======================================

The RPM packages are suitable for installation on Red Hat, CentOS and other RPM-based systems.

.. note:: Many of the commands described below need to be executed with root user privileges.

Preparation
-----------

1. Oracle Java JRE 8 is required by Logstash and Elasticsearch.

  .. note::

    The following command accepts the necessary cookies to download Oracle Java JRE. Please, visit `Oracle Java 8 JRE Download Page <https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp>`_ for more information.

  .. code-block:: console

    # curl -Lo jre-8-linux-x64.rpm --header "Cookie: oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie" "https://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u202-b08/1961070e4c9b4e26a04e7f5a083f551e/jre-8u202-linux-x64.rpm"

  Now, check if the package was download successfully:

  .. code-block:: console

    # rpm -qlp jre-8-linux-x64.rpm > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "Java package downloaded successfully" || echo "Java package did not download successfully"

  Finally, install the RPM package using yum:

  .. code-block:: console

    # yum -y install jre-8-linux-x64.rpm
    # rm -f jre-8-linux-x64.rpm

2. Install the Elastic repository and its GPG key:

  .. code-block:: console

    # rpm --import https://packages.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch

    # cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/elastic.repo << EOF
    [elasticsearch-6.x]
    name=Elasticsearch repository for 6.x packages
    baseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/6.x/yum
    gpgcheck=1
    gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
    enabled=1
    autorefresh=1
    type=rpm-md
    EOF

Elasticsearch
-------------

Elasticsearch is a highly scalable full-text search and analytics engine. For more information, please see `Elasticsearch <https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch>`_.

1. Install the Elasticsearch package:

  .. code-block:: console

    # yum install elasticsearch-6.6.1

2. Enable and start the Elasticsearch service:

  a) For Systemd:

  .. code-block:: console

    # systemctl daemon-reload
    # systemctl enable elasticsearch.service
    # systemctl start elasticsearch.service

  b) For SysV Init:

  .. code-block:: console

    # chkconfig --add elasticsearch
    # service elasticsearch start

  It's important to wait until the Elasticsearch server finishes starting. Check the current status with the following command, which should give you a response like the shown below:

  .. code-block:: console

    # curl "http://localhost:9200/?pretty"

    {
      "name" : "Zr2Shu_",
      "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
      "cluster_uuid" : "M-W_RznZRA-CXykh_oJsCQ",
      "version" : {
        "number" : "6.6.1",
        "build_flavor" : "default",
        "build_type" : "rpm",
        "build_hash" : "053779d",
        "build_date" : "2018-07-20T05:20:23.451332Z",
        "build_snapshot" : false,
        "lucene_version" : "7.3.1",
        "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "5.6.0",
        "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "5.0.0"
      },
      "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
    }

3. Load the Wazuh template for Elasticsearch:

  .. warning::
    The Wazuh app for Kibana needs the Elasticsearch template in order to work properly, so it's important to make sure that it was properly inserted.

  .. code-block:: console

    # curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wazuh/wazuh/3.8/extensions/elasticsearch/wazuh-elastic6-template-alerts.json | curl -X PUT "http://localhost:9200/_template/wazuh" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @-

.. note::

    It is recommended that the default configuration be edited to improve the performance of Elasticsearch. To do so, please see :ref:`elastic_tuning`.

.. _elastic_server_rpm_logstash:

Logstash
--------

Logstash is the tool that collects, parses, and forwards data to Elasticsearch for indexing and storage of all logs generated by the Wazuh server. For more information, please see `Logstash <https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash>`_.

1. Install the Logstash package:

  .. code-block:: console

    # yum install logstash-6.6.1

2. Download the Wazuh configuration file for Logstash:

  - **Local** configuration (only in a **single-host architecture**):

    .. code-block:: console

      # curl -so /etc/logstash/conf.d/01-wazuh.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wazuh/wazuh/3.8/extensions/logstash/01-wazuh-local.conf

    Because the Logstash user needs to read the alerts.json file, please add it to OSSEC group by running:

    .. code-block:: console

      # usermod -a -G ossec logstash

  - **Remote** configuration (only in a **distributed architecture**):

    .. code-block:: console

      # curl -so /etc/logstash/conf.d/01-wazuh.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wazuh/wazuh/3.8/extensions/logstash/01-wazuh-remote.conf


.. note::

    Follow the next steps if you use CentOS-6/RHEL-6 or Amazon AMI (logstash uses Upstart like a service manager and needs to be fixed, see `this bug <https://bugs.launchpad.net/upstart/+bug/812870/>`_):

    1) Edit the file /etc/logstash/startup.options changing line 30 from *LS_GROUP=logstash* to *LS_GROUP=ossec*.
    2) Update the service with the new parameters by running the command /usr/share/logstash/bin/system-install
    3) Restart Logstash.

3. Enable and start the Logstash service:

  a) For Systemd:

  .. code-block:: console

    # systemctl daemon-reload
    # systemctl enable logstash.service
    # systemctl start logstash.service

  b) For SysV Init:

  .. code-block:: console

    # chkconfig --add logstash
    # service logstash start

.. note::

    If you are running the Wazuh server and the Elastic Stack server on separate systems (**distributed architecture**), it is important to configure encryption between Filebeat and Logstash. To do so, please see :ref:`elastic_ssl`.

.. _install_kibana_app_rpm:

Kibana
------

Kibana is a flexible and intuitive web interface for mining and visualizing the events and archives stored in Elasticsearch. Find more information at `Kibana <https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana>`_.

1. Install the Kibana package:

  .. code-block:: console

    # yum install kibana-6.6.1

2. Install the Wazuh app plugin for Kibana:

  a) With sudo:

  .. code-block:: console

    # sudo -u kibana NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=3072" /usr/share/kibana/bin/kibana-plugin install https://packages.wazuh.com/wazuhapp/wazuhapp-3.8.2_6.6.1.zip

  b) Without sudo:

  .. code-block:: console

    # su -c 'NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=3072" /usr/share/kibana/bin/kibana-plugin install https://packages.wazuh.com/wazuhapp/wazuhapp-3.8.2_6.5.4.zip' kibana

  .. warning::

    The Kibana plugin installation process may take several minutes. Please wait patiently.

3. **Optional.** Kibana will only listen on the loopback interface (localhost) by default. To set up Kibana to listen on all interfaces, edit the file ``/etc/kibana/kibana.yml`` uncommenting the setting ``server.host``. Change the value to:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    server.host: "0.0.0.0"

  .. note::

    It is recommended that an Nginx proxy be set up for Kibana in order to use SSL encryption and to enable authentication. Instructions to set up the proxy can be found at :ref:`kibana_ssl`.

4. Enable and start the Kibana service:

  a) For Systemd:

  .. code-block:: console

    # systemctl daemon-reload
    # systemctl enable kibana.service
    # systemctl start kibana.service

  b) For SysV Init:

  .. code-block:: console

    # chkconfig --add kibana
    # service kibana start

5. (Optional) Disable the Elasticsearch repository:

  It is recommended that the Elasticsearch repository be disabled in order to prevent an upgrade to a newer Elastic Stack version due to the possibility of undoing changes with the App. To do this, use the following command:

  .. code-block:: console

    # sed -i "s/^enabled=1/enabled=0/" /etc/yum.repos.d/elastic.repo

Next steps
----------

Once the Wazuh and Elastic Stack servers are installed and connected, you can install and connect Wazuh agents. Follow :ref:`this guide <installation_agents>` and read the instructions for your specific environment.

You can also read the Kibana app :ref:`user manual <kibana_app>` to learn more about its features and how to use it.
