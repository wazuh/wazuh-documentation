Install Elastic Stack with Debian packages
==========================================

The DEB package is suitable for Debian, Ubuntu and other Debian-based systems.

.. note:: Many of the commands described below need to be executed with root user privileges.

Preparation
-----------

1. Oracle Java JRE 8 is required by Logstash and Elasticsearch:

  a) For Debian:

  .. code-block:: console

    # echo "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu xenial main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/webupd8team-java.list
    # echo "deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu xenial main" | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/webupd8team-java.list
    # apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys EEA14886

  b) For Ubuntu:

  .. code-block:: console

    # add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java

2. Once the repository is added, install Java JRE:

  .. code-block:: console

    # apt-get update
    # apt-get install oracle-java8-installer

3. Install the Elastic repository and its GPG key:

  .. code-block:: console

    # apt-get install curl apt-transport-https
    # curl -s https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | apt-key add -
    # echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/6.x/apt stable main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-6.x.list
    # apt-get update

Elasticsearch
-------------

Elasticsearch is a highly scalable full-text search and analytics engine. For more information, please see `Elasticsearch <https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch>`_.

1. Install the Elasticsearch package:

  .. code-block:: console

    # apt-get install elasticsearch=6.3.0

2. Enable and start the Elasticsearch service:

  a) For Systemd:

  .. code-block:: console

    # systemctl daemon-reload
    # systemctl enable elasticsearch.service
    # systemctl start elasticsearch.service

  b) For SysV Init:

  .. code-block:: console

    # update-rc.d elasticsearch defaults 95 10
    # service elasticsearch start

  It's important to wait until the Elasticsearch server finishes starting. Check the current status with the following command, which should give you a response like the shown below:

  .. code-block:: console

    # curl localhost:9200/?pretty

    {
      "name" : "116m4ct",
      "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
      "cluster_uuid" : "2TbJlE6MRBKB6uHybVSQJA",
      "version" : {
        "number" : "6.3.0",
        "build_flavor" : "default",
        "build_type" : "deb",
        "build_hash" : "424e937",
        "build_date" : "2018-06-11T23:38:03.357887Z",
        "build_snapshot" : false,
        "lucene_version" : "7.3.1",
        "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "5.6.0",
        "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "5.0.0"
      },
      "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
    }

3. Load the Wazuh template for Elasticsearch:

  .. code-block:: console

    # curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wazuh/wazuh/3.3/extensions/elasticsearch/wazuh-elastic6-template-alerts.json | curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_template/wazuh' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d @-

.. note::

    It is recommended that the default configuration be edited to improve the performance of Elasticsearch. To do so, please see :ref:`elastic_tuning`.

Logstash
--------

Logstash is the tool that collects, parses, and forwards data to Elasticsearch for indexing and storage of all logs generated by the Wazuh server. For more information please see `Logstash <https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash>`_.

1. Install the Logstash package:

  .. code-block:: console

    # apt-get install logstash=1:6.3.0-1

2. Download the Wazuh configuration file for Logstash:

  a) **Local** configuration (only in a **single-host architecture**):

    .. code-block:: console

      # curl -so /etc/logstash/conf.d/01-wazuh.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wazuh/wazuh/3.3/extensions/logstash/01-wazuh-local.conf

    Because the Logstash user needs to read the alerts.json file, please add it to OSSEC group by running:

    .. code-block:: console

      # usermod -a -G ossec logstash

  b) **Remote** configuration (only in a **distributed architecture**):

    .. code-block:: console

      # curl -so /etc/logstash/conf.d/01-wazuh.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wazuh/wazuh/3.3/extensions/logstash/01-wazuh-remote.conf


3. Enable and start the Logstash service:

  a) For Systemd:

  .. code-block:: console

    # systemctl daemon-reload
    # systemctl enable logstash.service
    # systemctl start logstash.service

  b) For SysV Init:

  .. code-block:: console

    # update-rc.d logstash defaults 95 10
    # service logstash start

.. note::

    If you are running Wazuh server and the Elastic Stack server on separate systems (**distributed architecture**), it is important to configure encryption between Filebeat and Logstash. To do so, please see :ref:`elastic_ssl`.

Kibana
------

Kibana is a flexible and intuitive web interface for mining and visualizing the events and archives stored in Elasticsearch. Find more information at `Kibana <https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana>`_.

1. Install the Kibana package:

  .. code-block:: console

    # apt-get install kibana=6.3.0

2. Install the Wazuh App plugin for Kibana:

  a) Increase the default Node.js heap memory limit to prevent out of memory errors when installing the Wazuh App.
  Set the limit as follows:

  .. code-block:: console

    # export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=3072"

  b) Install the Wazuh App:

  .. code-block:: console

    # /usr/share/kibana/bin/kibana-plugin install https://packages.wazuh.com/wazuhapp/wazuhapp-3.3.1_6.3.0.zip

  .. warning::

    The Kibana plugin installation process may take several minutes. Please wait patiently.

  .. note::

    If you want to download a different Wazuh App plugin for another version of Wazuh or the Elastic Stack, check the table available at `GitHub <https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app#installation>`_ and use the appropriate installation command.

3. **Optional.** Kibana will only listen on the loopback interface (localhost) by default. To set up Kibana to listen on all interfaces, edit the file ``/etc/kibana/kibana.yml`` uncommenting the setting ``server.host``. Change the value to:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    server.host: "0.0.0.0"

  .. note::

    It is recommended that an Nginx proxy be set up for Kibana in order to use SSL encryption and to enable authentication. Instructions to set up the proxy can be found at :ref:`kibana_ssl`.

4. Enable and start the Kibana service:

  a) For Systemd:

  .. code-block:: console

    # systemctl daemon-reload
    # systemctl enable kibana.service
    # systemctl start kibana.service

  b) For SysV Init:

  .. code-block:: console

    # update-rc.d kibana defaults 95 10
    # service kibana start

5. Disable the Elasticsearch repository:

  It is recommended that the Elasticsearch repository be disabled in order to prevent an upgrade to a newer Elastic Stack version due to the possibility of undoing changes with the App.  To do this, use the following command:

  .. code-block:: console

    # sed -i "s/^deb/#deb/" /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-6.x.list
    # apt-get update

Next steps
----------

Once the Wazuh and Elastic Stack servers are installed and connected, you can install and connect Wazuh agents. Follow :ref:`this guide <installation_agents>` and read the instructions for your specific environment.

You can also read the Kibana app :ref:`user manual <kibana_app>` to learn more about its features and how to use it.
