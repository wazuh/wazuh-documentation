Installing Splunk
=================

This guide describes the installation of a Splunk infrastructure comprised of a Splunk Enterprise instance as indexer and a Splunk Forwarder node.
In addition to Splunk Enterprise components, you will also find the instructions to install and configure the Wazuh app for Splunk.

These are the two main components in a common Splunk simple distributed architecture:

- **Splunk Forwarder:** This component runs on the Wazuh manager and Wazuh API instance, it reads from local data inputs and formats them, then sends those events for being indexed. In a Wazuh scenario, this kind of data to be forwarded are the Wazuh generated alerts and stored in ``alerts.json`` file. 

- **Splunk Indexer**: This component runs the Splunk engine. It reads the previously forwarded data, parses it, indexes it and stores it in form of events that contain alert data generated by Wazuh manager and sended by the Forwarder instance.
