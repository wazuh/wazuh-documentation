Installing the Wazuh server using the assisted installation method
==================================================================

Install the Wazuh server as a single-node or multi-node cluster on a 64-bit (x86_64/AMD64 or AARCH64/ARM64) architecture using the assisted installation method. The Wazuh server analyzes the data received from the agents, triggering alerts when it detects threats and anomalies. This central component includes the Wazuh manager and Filebeat.

Wazuh server cluster installation
---------------------------------

#. Download the Wazuh installation assistant.

   .. code-block:: console
   
       # curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/|WAZUH_CURRENT_MINOR|/wazuh-install.sh

#. Run the Wazuh installation assistant with the option ``--wazuh-server`` followed by the node name to install the Wazuh server. The node name must be the same one used in ``config.yml`` for the initial configuration, for example, ``wazuh-1``. The Wazuh installation assistant requires dependencies like ``openssl`` and ``lsof`` to work. To install them automatically, add the ``--install-dependencies`` option to the command.
 
   .. note:: Make sure that a copy of the ``wazuh-install-files.tar``, created during the initial configuration step, is placed in your working directory.

   .. code-block:: console
  
       # bash wazuh-install.sh --wazuh-server wazuh-1


Your Wazuh server is now successfully installed. 

.. note:: The passwords for the ``wazuh`` and ``wazuh-wui`` users have been updated. To view all the passwords, you can run the following command:
   :class: not-long

   .. code-block:: console

      # tar -O -xvf wazuh-install-files.tar wazuh-install-files/wazuh-passwords.txt

- If you want a Wazuh server single-node cluster, everything is set and you can proceed directly with :doc:`../wazuh-dashboard/installation-assistant`.
      
- If you want a Wazuh server multi-node cluster, repeat this process on every Wazuh server node.
