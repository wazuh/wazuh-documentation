         #. To deploy the Wazuh agent on your endpoint, choose your architecture, edit the ``WAZUH_MANAGER`` variable to contain your Wazuh manager IP address or hostname, and run the following command. 

            .. tabs::

               .. group-tab:: Intel

                  .. code-block:: console

                     # echo "WAZUH_MANAGER='10.0.0.2'" > /tmp/wazuh_envs && sudo installer -pkg wazuh-agent-|WAZUH_CURRENT_OSX|-|WAZUH_REVISION_OSX|.intel64.pkg -target /

               .. group-tab:: Apple silicon

                  .. versionadded:: 4.5.1

                  .. code-block:: console

                     # echo "WAZUH_MANAGER='10.0.0.2'" > /tmp/wazuh_envs && sudo installer -pkg wazuh-agent-|WAZUH_CURRENT_OSX|-|WAZUH_REVISION_OSX|.arm64.pkg -target /

               For additional deployment options such as agent name, agent group, and registration password, see the :doc:`Deployment variables for macOS </user-manual/agent/agent-enrollment/deployment-variables/deployment-variables-macos>` section.

               .. note:: Alternatively, if you want to install an agent without registering it, omit the deployment variables. To learn more about the different registration methods, see the :doc:`Wazuh agent enrollment </user-manual/agent/agent-enrollment/index>` section.

         #. To complete the installation process, start the Wazuh agent.

            .. code-block:: console

               # launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.wazuh.agent.plist


         The installation process is now complete, and the Wazuh agent is successfully deployed and running on your macOS endpoint.

            .. code-block:: console

               # launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.wazuh.agent.plist

         The installation process is now complete, and the Wazuh agent is successfully installed on your macOS endpoint. The next step is to register and configure the agent to communicate with the Wazuh server. To perform this action, see the :doc:`Wazuh agent enrollment </user-manual/agent/agent-enrollment/index>` section.  

By default, all agent files are stored in ``/Library/Ossec/`` after the installation.
