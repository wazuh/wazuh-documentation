Installing Wazuh agents on HP-UX endpoints
==========================================

.. warning::

   Support for HP-UX systems ends in Wazuh 5.0.0.

The installed agent runs on the endpoint you want to monitor and communicates with the Wazuh manager, sending data in near real-time through an encrypted and authenticated channel.

.. note:: You need root user privileges to run all the commands described below.

#. To start the installation process, download the `HP-UX installer <https://packages.wazuh.com/|WAZUH_CURRENT_MAJOR_HPUX|/hp-ux/wazuh-agent-|WAZUH_CURRENT_HPUX|-|WAZUH_REVISION_HPUX|-hpux-11v3-ia64.tar.gz>`_.

#. Create the ``wazuh`` user and group.

   .. code-block:: console

       # groupadd wazuh
       # useradd -G wazuh wazuh

#. Uncompress the package in ``/``.

   .. code-block:: console

       # gzip -d wazuh-agent-|WAZUH_CURRENT_HPUX|-|WAZUH_REVISION_HPUX|-hpux-11v3-ia64.tar.gz
       # tar -xvf wazuh-agent-|WAZUH_CURRENT_HPUX|-|WAZUH_REVISION_HPUX|-hpux-11v3-ia64.tar


The installation process is now complete, and the Wazuh agent is successfully installed on your HP-UX endpoint. The next step is to register and configure the agent to communicate with the Wazuh server. To perform this action, see the :doc:`Linux/Unix agent enrollment via agent configuration </user-manual/agent/agent-enrollment/enrollment-methods/via-agent-configuration/linux-endpoint>` section. To learn more about agent enrollment, visit :doc:`Wazuh agent enrollment </user-manual/agent/agent-enrollment/index>`.
