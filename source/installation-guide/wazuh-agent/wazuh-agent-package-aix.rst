  :description: Learn how to deploy the Wazuh agent on AIX using deployment variables that facilitate the task of installing, registering, and configuring the agent.

Deploying Wazuh agents on AIX endpoints
=======================================

.. warning::

   Support for AIX systems ends in Wazuh 5.0.0.

The agent runs on the endpoint you want to monitor and communicates with the Wazuh server, sending data in near real-time through an encrypted and authenticated channel.

The deployment of a Wazuh agent on an AIX system uses deployment variables that facilitate the task of installing, registering, and configuring the agent.

.. note::

   You need root user privileges to run all the commands described below.

   Required dependencies:
      * bash

#. To start the deployment process, download the `AIX installer <https://packages.wazuh.com/|WAZUH_CURRENT_MAJOR_AIX|/aix/wazuh-agent-|WAZUH_CURRENT_AIX|-|WAZUH_REVISION_AIX|.aix.ppc.rpm>`_.

#. To deploy the Wazuh agent to your endpoint, edit the ``WAZUH_MANAGER`` variable so that it contains the Wazuh manager IP address or hostname.

   .. code-block:: console

      # WAZUH_MANAGER="10.0.0.2" rpm -ivh wazuh-agent-|WAZUH_CURRENT_AIX|-|WAZUH_REVISION_AIX|.aix.ppc.rpm

   For additional deployment options such as agent name, agent group, and registration password, see :doc:`Deployment variables for AIX </user-manual/agent/agent-enrollment/deployment-variables/deployment-variables-aix>` section.
   
   .. note:: Alternatively, if you want to install an agent without registering it, omit the deployment variables.  To learn more about the different registration methods, see the :doc:`Wazuh agent enrollment </user-manual/agent/agent-enrollment/index>` section.

#. To complete the installation process, start the Wazuh agent.

    .. code-block:: console

      # /var/ossec/bin/wazuh-control start


The deployment process is now complete, and the Wazuh agent is successfully running on your AIX endpoint.
