In this architecture, there are multiple Wazuh server nodes within the cluster. The Wazuh server cluster consists of a :ref:`master node <server-cluster-master-node>` and :ref:`worker nodes <server-cluster-worker-node>`. The Wazuh agents are configured to report to the server nodes in the cluster. This setup allows for horizontal scalability and enhances the performance of the Wazuh servers.
