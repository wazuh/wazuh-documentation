Offline Update
==============

If the Wazuh server isn't directly connected to the Internet, it's still possible to keep the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) information updated. You can download a repository file and access it within your local environment or network.

Downloading the Wazuh vulnerabilities file
------------------------------------------

We regularly publish a snapshot of the threat intelligence repository to the Cyber Threat Vulnerability Intelligence (CTI) API. We provide this snapshot as a downloadable file containing the CVE documents. To retrieve the link to download this compressed file and output its date, run a command to query the API as follows.

.. code-block:: console

   $ response=$(curl -s -X GET |CTI_URL|)
   $ echo "$response" | jq -r '.data.last_snapshot_link'
   $ echo "$response" | jq -r '.data.last_snapshot_at'

.. code-block:: none

Configure offline vulnerability detection
-----------------------------------------

To use the Vulnerability Detection module offline, follow these steps.

#. Edit the Wazuh server ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` file. Add the offline repository file path in the vulnerability detection block. This configures the Wazuh server to locate it.

   .. code-block:: xml
      :emphasize-lines: 5

      <vulnerability-detection>
         <enabled>yes</enabled>
         <index-status>yes</index-status>
         <feed-update-interval>60m</feed-update-interval>
         <offline-url>file:///path/to/the/cves.file.zip</offline-url>
      </vulnerability-detection>

#. Restart the Wazuh manager.
