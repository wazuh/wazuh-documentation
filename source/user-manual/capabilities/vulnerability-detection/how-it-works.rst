How it works
============

To detect vulnerabilities, Wazuh agents collect a list of installed applications from monitored endpoints and send it periodically to the Wazuh server. Local SQLite databases in the Wazuh server store this list. Within the Wazuh server, the Vulnerability Detection module correlates the software inventory data with vulnerability content documents to detect vulnerable software on the monitored endpoint. These documents are Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) records that are available in our Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) platform.

On the CTI platform, we aggregate vulnerability data from diverse sources like operating system vendors and vulnerability databases, consolidating it into a unified, reliable repository. The process involves standardizing the varied formats into a common structure using the CVE JSON 5 format.

We maintain the integrity of our vulnerability data by doing the following additional tasks.

-  Rectifying format inconsistencies like version errors and typos.
-  Completing missing information.
-  Incorporating new cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

Subsequently, we merge this content, uploading the compiled documents to a cloud server. And finally, we publish these documents to our CTI API.

To update the vulnerability information on the Wazuh server, the vulnerability detection module queries the CTI API or an offline local repository. It retrieves new documents and compares them to the existing ones to identify any differences.

Next, the module scans the software inventory of the endpoints using the latest available vulnerability information. The detection process looks for vulnerable packages in the inventory databases. These inventories are unique to each agent.

A package is marked as vulnerable when its version falls within the affected range of a CVE. The module generates alerts to display the results, and the findings are stored in a general vulnerability inventory. This inventory is filterable by agent and contains only unresolved vulnerabilities. Users can :ref:`query the inventory <vuln_det_poc_alert_visualize>` to review alerts and details about vulnerabilities.

For Microsoft Windows systems and certain Microsoft products, the Vulnerability Detection module includes the :ref:`wodle_syscollector_hotfixes` option in the Wazuh agent's :ref:`Syscollector <system_inventory>` settings. Enabling this option allows the module to detect packages that users have patched. When a patch is detected, the module uses information provided by Microsoft to verify whether the patch resolves the relevant CVEs. If it does, the module removes those vulnerabilities from the list.

Alert generation
----------------

The Vulnerability Detection module generates alerts when it detects new vulnerabilities or when a vulnerability is fixed due to a package update, removal, or system upgrade. However, to enhance the reliability of the Wazuh platform, the conditions mentioned above are necessary but not enough for alert generation. An alert indicates that something has just happened, but that isn't always the case:

-  **OS alerts**: These are not generated during the initial scan but in subsequent scans. If the agent is syncing with the manager for the first time, it does not register that the OS version has changed or that a patch was recently applied.

-  **Package alerts**: Alerts are triggered when the installation or removal of a package results in a change in the vulnerability inventory. However, this occurs only when the agent detects the event during a regular :ref:`Syscollector <system_inventory>` scan. Changes made while the agent is stopped or forced to be reported through a restart do not generate alerts.

Other factors to consider regarding alert generation include:

-  **Cluster environment**: If an agent switches to a different node, its inventory syncs with the new node, but no alerts are generated during this initial sync.
-  **Content update**: When content changes, all agents are re-scanned to ensure results are up to date, but no alerts are generated during this initial sync.

 You can refer to the diagram below for a visual representation of this workflow.

Considering all possible situations, the most reliable way to determine the current vulnerabilities in the environment is to query the vulnerability inventory.

Compatibility Matrix
====================

We continuously expand our compatibility list to include new operating systems. The following table highlights the operating systems officially supported by the Vulnerability Detection module. While other systems are also supported, we don't guarantee full detection.
