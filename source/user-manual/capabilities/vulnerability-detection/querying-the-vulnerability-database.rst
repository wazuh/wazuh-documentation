Querying the vulnerability database
===================================

You can find the vulnerability database at ``/var/ossec/queue/vulnerabilities/cve.db`` on the Wazuh server and query it using ``SQLite``. ``SQLite`` provides an interface that you can use to interact with SQL databases. 

Perform the following steps to query the vulnerability database using SQLite.

#. Start ``SQLite`` and open the vulnerability database using the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      # sqlite3 /var/ossec/queue/vulnerabilities/cve.db

#. List the tables in the database using the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      sqlite> .tables

#. Retrieve all the data in a table by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      sqlite> SELECT * from <TABLE>;

Replace ``<TABLE>`` with the name of the table you are interested in. 

.. Warning::
   Don’t make changes to the database. It can lead to issues when the Vulnerability Detector module is running a scan.

Use Case: Find all KBs that patch a specified CVE for Windows endpoints
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, you will see how to find all Windows Knowledge Base (KB) updates that patch a specific vulnerability on Windows endpoints from the vulnerability database. You can achieve this using ``SQLite`` on the Wazuh server.

#. Start ``SQLite`` and open the vulnerability database using the following command:

   .. code-block:: console

      # sqlite3 /var/ossec/queue/vulnerabilities/cve.db

#. Run ``.mode line`` in the SQLite prompt to configure the SQLite output format.

#. Run the following command to view all the details of the chosen CVE and operating system: 

   .. code-block:: console

      # SELECT * FROM msu WHERE cveid = "<CVE_ID>" AND PRODUCT LIKE "%<OS_IDENTIFIER>%";

   Where:

   - ``<OS_IDENTIFIER>`` is a string from the operating system name. It displays result for only the specified operating system.
   - ``<CVE_ID>`` is the identifier for the CVE. 

   You can see an example below:
   
   .. code-block:: console

      sqlite> SELECT * FROM msu WHERE cveid = "CVE-2023-21524" AND PRODUCT LIKE "%Server 2022%";

   .. code-block:: console
      :class: output
      :emphasize-lines: 3,12       

      CVEID = CVE-2023-21524
               PRODUCT = Windows Server 2022 (Server Core installation)
                 PATCH = 5022291
                 TITLE = Windows Local Security Authority (LSA) Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability
                   URL = https://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB5022291
               SUBTYPE = Security Update
      RESTART_REQUIRED = Yes
            CHECK_TYPE = 1
   
                 CVEID = CVE-2023-21524
               PRODUCT = Windows Server 2022
                 PATCH = 5022291
                 TITLE = Windows Local Security Authority (LSA) Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability
                   URL = https://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB5022291
               SUBTYPE = Security Update
      RESTART_REQUIRED = Yes
            CHECK_TYPE = 1

#. Run the command below to list all the KBs that patch ``KB5022291`` replaces. This will be a list of patches that are no longer necessary to install once a user installs ``KB5022291``.

   .. code-block:: console

      sqlite> SELECT patch FROM msu_supersedence WHERE super = "5022291";

   .. code-block:: console
      :class: output

      PATCH = 5010796

      PATCH = 5022291

      PATCH = 5022553

      PATCH = 5021656

      PATCH = 5021249

      PATCH = 5020436

      PATCH = 5020032
      ...

#. Run the command below to get a list of all the patches that replaced ``KB5022291``. This list contains all the patches that resolve the same vulnerabilities as ``KB5022291`` when installed. 

   .. code-block:: console

      sqlite> SELECT super FROM msu_supersedence WHERE patch = "5022291";

   .. code-block:: console
      :class: output

      SUPER = 5022291
      SUPER = 5022842
      SUPER = 5023705
      SUPER = 5025230
      SUPER = 5026370
