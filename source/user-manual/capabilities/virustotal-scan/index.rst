VirusTotal integration
======================

.. versionadded:: 3.0.0

From version 3.0.0, Wazuh incorporates a new integration which scans monitored files for malicious content.

This solution is possible through an integration with VirusTotal, which is a powerful platform that aggregates multiple antivirus products along with an online scanning engine. Combining this tool with our FIM engine provides a simple means of scanning the files that are monitored by **syscheck** to inspect them for malicious content.
