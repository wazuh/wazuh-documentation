VirusTotal integration
======================

Wazuh can scan monitored files for malicious content in monitored files. This solution is possible through an integration with VirusTotal, which is a powerful platform that aggregates multiple antivirus products along with an online scanning engine. Combining this tool with our FIM engine provides a simple means of scanning the files that are monitored to inspect them for malicious content.
