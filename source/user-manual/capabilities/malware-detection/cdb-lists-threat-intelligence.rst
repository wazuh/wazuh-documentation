CDB lists and threat intelligence
=================================

Wazuh detects malicious files by checking the presence of their signatures in a CDB list. This CDB list must contain known malware threat intelligence indicators. A CDB list is a text file you can use to save a list of users, file hashes, IP addresses, and domain names. You can add entries to a CDB list in ``key:value`` pairs or ``key:`` only. CDB lists can act as either allow or deny lists. You can learn more about :doc:`CDB lists </user-manual/ruleset/cdb-list>` in the documentation.

How it works
------------

Wazuh checks if field values, such as IP address, file hashes, and others, extracted from security events during decoding are in a CDB list to hunt and detect malware. To detect malware, you can use CDB lists with the file integrity monitoring (FIM) module. We describe how it works below:

#. The Wazuh FIM module scans monitored directories on endpoints to detect changes such as file creation and modifications. The FIM module stores the checksums and attributes of the monitored files.

#. When the FIM module generates an alert, the Wazuh analysis engine compares the file attributes, for example, the file hash, to the keys in a predefined CDB list.
#. If the Wazuh analysis engine finds a match, it generates or suppresses an alert based on how you configure your rule.

Use case: Detecting malware using file hashes in a CDB list
-----------------------------------------------------------

In this use case, we show how you can detect malware using file hashes that you have added to a CDB list. You can use this use case to detect malicious files on a Linux endpoint on which you have installed a Wazuh agent.

Wazuh server
^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Create a CDB list ``malware-hashes`` of known malware hashes and save it to the ``/var/ossec/etc/lists`` directory on the Wazuh server.

   .. code-block:: console

      # vi /var/ossec/etc/lists/malware-hashes

#. Add the known malware hashes to the file as ``key:value`` pairs. In this case, you can use the known MD5 hashes of the *Mirai* and *Xbash* malware as shown below.

   .. code-block:: console

      e0ec2cd43f71c80d42cd7b0f17802c73:mirai
      55142f1d393c5ba7405239f232a6c059:Xbash

#. Add a reference to the CDB list in the Wazuh manager configuration file ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf``. You can do this by specifying the path to the list within the ``<ruleset>`` block:

   .. code-block:: console
      :emphasize-lines: 10

      ...
        <ruleset>
          <!-- Default ruleset -->
          <decoder_dir>ruleset/decoders</decoder_dir>
          <rule_dir>ruleset/rules</rule_dir>
          <rule_exclude>0215-policy_rules.xml</rule_exclude>
          <list>etc/lists/audit-keys</list>
          <list>etc/lists/amazon/aws-eventnames</list>
          <list>etc/lists/security-eventchannel</list>
          <list>etc/lists/malware-hashes</list>
        <ruleset>
      ...

#. Create a custom rule in the ``/var/ossec/etc/rules/local_rules.xml`` file on the Wazuh server. The rule generates alerts when the Wazuh analysis engine matches the MD5 hash of a new or modified file to a hash in the CDB list. Rules 554 and 550 must previously match indicating a recently created or modified file.

   .. code-block:: xml

      <group name="malware,">
        <rule id="110002" level="13">
          <!-- The if_sid tag references the built-in FIM rules -->
          <if_sid>554, 550</if_sid>
          <list field="md5" lookup="match_key">etc/lists/malware-hashes</list>
          <description>File with known malware hash detected: $(file)</description>
          <mitre>
            <id>T1204.002</id>
          </mitre>
        </rule>
      </group>

#. Restart the Wazuh manager to apply changes.

   .. code-block:: console

      # systemctl restart wazuh-manager

Linux endpoint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Configure directory monitoring by adding the ``<directories>`` block specifying the folders you want to monitor in the agent configuration file or using the :doc:`centralized configuration </user-manual/reference/centralized-configuration>` option.

   .. code-block:: xml

      <ossec_config>
        <syscheck>
          <disabled>no</disabled>
          <directories check_all="yes" realtime="yes">/PATH/TO/MONITORED/DIRECTORY</directories>
        </syscheck>
      </ossec_config>

   .. note::

      The ``check_all`` option ensures Wazuh checks all file attributes including the file size, permissions, owner, last modification date, inode, and the hash sums.

#. Restart the Wazuh agent to apply the changes:

   .. code-block:: console

      # systemctl restart wazuh-agent

Test the configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To test that everything works correctly, download the *Mirai* and *Xbash* malware samples to the directory the FIM module is monitoring.

.. warning::

   These malicious files are dangerous, so use them for testing purposes only. Do not install them in production environments.

#. Download the malware samples. Replace ``/PATH/TO/MONITORED/DIRECTORY`` with the path of the monitored directory.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ sudo curl https://wazuh-demo.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mirai --output /PATH/TO/MONITORED/DIRECTORY/mirai
      $ sudo curl https://wazuh-demo.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/xbash --output /PATH/TO/MONITORED/DIRECTORY/Xbash

Visualize the alerts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can see these alerts on the Wazuh dashboard. To do this, go to the **Threat Hunting** tab of the Wazuh dashboard to view the alerts.
