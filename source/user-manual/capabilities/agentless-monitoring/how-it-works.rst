How it works
============

Connection
----------

In order to connect the manager to the device using SSH authentication, the following ``register_host.sh`` script should be used. This script is located in the ``/var/ossec/agentless/`` directory and has two options: ``list``  and ``add``.

Using the ``list`` option will list all hosts already included.

.. code-block:: console

  # /var/ossec/agentless/register_host.sh list

Using the ``add`` option will specify a new device to be added to the manager. ``NOPASS`` (case sensitive) may be entered as the password to use public key authentication rather than using a password.  For Cisco devices, such as routers or firewalls, ``enablepass`` should be used to specify the enable password.

.. code-block:: console

  # /var/ossec/agentless/register_host.sh add root@example_address.com example_password [enablepass]

Public key authentication can be used with the following command:

.. code-block:: console

  # sudo -u ossec ssh-keygen

Once created, the public key must be copied into the remote device.

Monitoring
----------

After devices have been added to the list, the manager must be configured to monitor them. To view additional configuration options for the ``ossec.conf`` file, please refer to :ref:`agentless <reference_ossec_agentless>`.

BSD Integrity Check
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For BSD systems, set the ``type`` as ``ssh_integrity_check_bsd`` as referenced below.  A space-separated list of directories may be referenced in the configuration section using the ``<arguments>`` tag.  Using this configuration, Wazuh will do an integrity check on the remote box.

.. code-block:: xml

  <agentless>
    <type>ssh_integrity_check_bsd</type>
    <frequency>20000</frequency>
    <host>root@test.com</host>
    <state>periodic</state>
    <arguments>/bin /var/</arguments>
  </agentless>

Linux Integrity Check
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For Linux systems, set the ``type`` as ``ssh_integrity_check_linux`` as referenced below.  A space-separated list of directories may be referenced in the configuration section using the ``<arguments>`` tag.  Using this configuration, Wazuh will do an integrity check on the remote box.

.. code-block:: xml

  <agentless>
    <type>ssh_integrity_check_linux</type>
    <frequency>36000</frequency>
    <host>root@test.com</host>
    <state>periodic</state>
    <arguments>/bin /etc/ /sbin</arguments>
  </agentless>

Generic Diff
^^^^^^^^^^^^
A set of commands can also be configured to run on a remote device. Wazuh will alert you if the output of those commands changes. In order to use this option, set the ``type`` as ``ssh_generic_diff``, as shown below.

.. code-block:: xml

  <agentless>
    <type>ssh_generic_diff</type>
    <frequency>20000</frequency>
    <host>root@test.com</host>
    <state>periodic_diff</state>
    <arguments>ls -la /etc; cat /etc/passwd</arguments>
  </agentless>

.. note::

  To use ``su`` in a command as an argument, ``use_su`` must be set before the hostname. In the previous example, this would appear as: ``<host>use_su root@example_address.com</host>``


Pix config
^^^^^^^^^^
This option will alert if a Cisco PIX/router configuration changes. Set the ``type`` to ``ssh_pixconfig_diff``, as shown below.

.. code-block:: xml

  <agentless>
    <type>ssh_pixconfig_diff</type>
    <frequency>36000</frequency>
    <host>pix@pix.fw.local</host>
    <state>periodic_diff</state>
  </agentless>

Checking the setup
------------------

Finally, the ``expect`` package must be present on the manager for this feature to work.

When the ``expect`` package is present and Wazuh is restarted, the following is shown in the ``/var/ossec/logs/ossec.log`` file:

.. code-block:: none
  :class: output

  ossec-agentlessd: INFO: Test passed for 'ssh_integrity_check_linux'.

When Wazuh has connected to the remote device, the following will be shown in the same log file:

.. code-block:: none
  :class: output

  ossec-agentlessd: INFO: ssh_integrity_check_linux: root@example_adress.com: Starting.
  ossec-agentlessd: INFO: ssh_integrity_check_linux: root@example_adress.com: Finished.

Alert
-----
Once configured as above, Wazuh alerts will be triggered when changes occur within the directories:

Sample alerts are as follows:
