1. Wazuh agent scans the system and sends the checksums and attributes of the monitored files and Windows registry keys to the Wazuh manager. We can configure:

  - **Frequency**: By default, syscheck runs every 6 hours, but this is entirely configurable.
  - **Real-time monitoring**: Wazuh supports real-time file integrity monitoring on servers running Windows or Linux. Note that that the real-time option is only configurable for directories, not for single files.

2. Wazuh manager stores the checksums/attributes and looks for modifications by comparing the new values to the old values. It's possible to configure syscheck to report a diff summary of the actual changes made to text files.

3. An alert is generated if changes are detected on monitored files and/or registry keys.

  It's possible to handle false positives using configuration options like ``ignore``.  You can also create rules that profile files that are to be excluded from FIM alerts.

  Alert example, generated by **syscheck**:
