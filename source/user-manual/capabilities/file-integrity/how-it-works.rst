How it works
============

Since v3.12.0, Wazuh uses the new FIM module. To learn about the functionality of the FIM used in the previous Wazuh releases, please refer to the corresponding version of the documentation.

The FIM module is located in the Wazuh agent, where runs periodic scans of the system and stores the checksums and attributes of the monitored files and Windows registry keys in a local FIM database. The module looks for the modifications by comparing the new files’ checksums to the old checksums. All detected changes are reported to the Wazuh manager.

The new FIM synchronization mechanism ensures the file inventory in the Wazuh manager is always updated with respect to the Wazuh agent, allowing servicing FIM-related API queries regarding the Wazuh agents. The FIM synchronization is based on periodic calculations of integrity between the Wazuh agent’s and the Wazuh manager’s databases, updating in the Wazuh manager only those files that are outdated, optimizing the data transfer of FIM. Anytime the modifications are detected in the monitored files and/or registry keys, an alert is generated.

An example alert generated by FIM looks as follow:

.. code-block:: none

By default, each Wazuh agent has the syscheck enabled and preconfigured but it is recommended to review and amend the configuration of the monitored host.

File integrity monitoring results for the whole environment can be observed in the :ref:`Wazuh dashboard<kibana_app>` in the *Overview > Integrity monitoring* section:

Due to the changes made on the newest FIM, only the Wazuh agents which are in version starting from 3.12 will use new functionality. All the Wazuh agents below that version will keep reporting syscheck scan results as in the older versions. If the Wazuh agent is upgraded to the v3.12 and keeps its old configuration, will still use the new FIM module and the default synchronization settings.

After the Wazuh agent service restart, the FIM database is cleared. Changes in the monitored directories done while the service is not running will not be reported to the Wazuh manager. The same will happen to the changes that occur after the last scan and before the restart, the synchronization will not take place on the directories that are not monitored with the ``realtime`` or with the ``whodata``.

The following document contains examples for most of FIM use cases: :ref:`configuring FIM <fim-examples>`.
