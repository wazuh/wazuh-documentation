Vulnerability detection
=======================

.. versionadded:: 3.2.0

This capability can be used to detect applications that are known to be vulnerable (affected by a CVE).

- `Compatibility matrix`_
- `Use case: Running a vulnerability scan`_

How it works
------------

To be able to detect vulnerabilities, now agents are able to natively collect a list of installed applications, sending it periodically to the manager (where it is stored in local sqlite databases, one per agent). In addition, the manager builds a global vulnerabilities database, using public OVAL CVE repositories, using it later to cross correlate this information with agent's applications inventory data.

The global vulnerabilities database is created automatically, currently pulling data from the following repositories:

- `<https://people.canonical.com>`_: Used to pull CVEs for Ubuntu Linux distributions.
- `<https://www.redhat.com>`_: Used to pull CVEs for RedHat and CentOS Linux distributions.
- `<https://www.debian.com>`_: Used to pull CVEs for Debian Linux distributions.

This database can be configured to be updated periodically, ensuring that the solution will check for the very latest CVEs.

Once the global vulnerabilty database (with the CVEs) is created, the detection process will look for vulnerable packages in the inventory databases (unique per agent). Alerts are generated when a CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) affects a package that is known to be installed in one of the monitored servers.

Compatibility matrix
---------------------

The following table shows the operating systems that the vulnerability detector currently supports (we are working in supporting new ones):

+---------------+-----------------+
| Distribution  | Versions        |
+===============+=================+
| Redhat        | 5, 6, 7         |
+---------------+-----------------+
| Centos        | 5, 6, 7         |
+---------------+-----------------+
| Ubuntu        | 12, 14, 16, 18  |
+---------------+-----------------+
| Debian        | 7, 8, 9         |
+---------------+-----------------+
| Amazon Linux  | 1, 2            |
+---------------+-----------------+

.. note::
    To extract vulnerabilities from agents with Amazon Linux you will need to configure vulnerability-detector to use Red Hat 7 OVAL.

Use case: Running a vulnerability scan
---------------------------------------

The following example shows how to configure the necessary components to run the vulnerability detection process.

1. Enable the agent module used to collect installed packages on the monitored system.

  You can do this adding the following block of settings to your agent configuration file:

  .. code-block:: xml

    <wodle name="syscollector">
      <disabled>no</disabled>
      <interval>1h</interval>
      <packages>yes</packages>
    </wodle>

 Remember to restart the agent to apply changes: ``/var/ossec/bin/ossec-control restart``

 Check :doc:`Syscollector settings<../reference/ossec-conf/wodle-syscollector>` for more details.

2. Enable the manager module used to detect vulnerabilities.

  You can do this adding the following block of settings to your manager configuration file:

  .. code-block:: xml

    <wodle name="vulnerability-detector">
      <disabled>no</disabled>
      <interval>1m</interval>
      <run_on_start>yes</run_on_start>
      <feed name="ubuntu-18">
        <disabled>no</disabled>
        <update_interval>1h</update_interval>
      </feed>
    </wodle>

 Remember to restart the manager to apply changes: ``/var/ossec/bin/ossec-control restart``

 Check :doc:`Vulnerability detector settings<../reference/ossec-conf/wodle-vuln-detector>` for more details.

The following fields are captured in every alert:

- CVE: The CVE identifier for the corresponding vulnerability.
- Title: Short description of the impact of vulnerability.
- Severity: It specifies the impact of the vulnerability in terms of security.
- Published: Date when the vulnerability was included in the official database.
- Reference: URL of the official database website with extra information of the vulnerability.
- Rationale: Broad description of the vulnerability.
- State: This field informs if it exists a patch for the vulnerability (*fixed*) or instead, its state.

See below an example alert:

.. code-block:: console
    :emphasize-lines: 3,6
