Creating custom dashboards
==========================

This section describes the process of creating a set of custom visualizations using the Wazuh dashboard component. We also show how to add individually created visualizations together to create a custom dashboard.

Visualizing the data
--------------------

Data visualization enhances the ability to comprehend complex security data by providing a visual representation. This representation reveals patterns, trends, anomalies, and insights. This simplifies the interpretation of large datasets and makes it easier to identify security threats, assess the overall state of security, and make informed decisions.

There are different visualization techniques that can help make data clear and appealing. These visuals can be saved, combined for dashboards, and shared with others using the Wazuh dashboard.

We will cover the practical aspect of dashboard creation by creating different types of visualizations in the Wazuh dashboard and then integrating the visualizations to create a custom dashboard.

Creating visualizations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a visualization, click the upper-left menu icon and navigate to **Explore** > **Visualize**. This action will open a page where a list of visualizations is displayed if any have already been created. If not, the page will display a **Create new visualization** button.

Wazuh dashboard aggregation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Wazuh dashboard visualization contains two main aggregation objects:

-  Metrics aggregation.
-  Bucket aggregation.

Metric aggregation
''''''''''''''''''

Metric aggregation calculates metrics by aggregating data values. This contains the actual values of the metric to be calculated. Metric aggregation is typically represented on the Y-axis.

There are different types of metric aggregations as shown below:

-  **Average**: This is the average of a numeric field. It calculates the arithmetic mean of an existing set of data values. The average is obtained by adding up all the data values and dividing their sum by the total count.

   Average aggregation helps in calculating the average duration of security incidents, average severity score of alerts, average response time to resolve incidents, and more.

      :align: center
      :width: 80%
      :title: Average metrics aggregation
      :alt: Average metrics aggregation

-  **Count**: This is the number of data values that match a query within the selected index pattern. It counts the number of data points in a set and provides the total count of a queried event.

   Count aggregation helps determine the total number of security events, the number of alerts triggered by a specific rule, the number of failed login attempts, and more.

-  **Max**: This is the maximum value of a numeric field within a selected index pattern. Max identifies the highest value among a group of values.

   Max aggregation helps identify the maximum severity level of alerts, maximum CPU usage, and more.

      :align: center
      :width: 80%
      :title: Max metrics aggregation
      :alt: Max metrics aggregation

-  **Median**: This is the median value in a numeric field. Median determines the middle value in a sorted set of values within a selected index pattern by separating the higher half from the lower half of the data.

   Median aggregation helps to provide the middle value of event durations, helping to identify the typical or median response time.

-  **Min**: This is the minimum value in a numeric field set. Min identifies the lowest value among a group of values.

   Min aggregation helps determine the minimum severity level of alerts, minimum disk space usage, minimum number of successful logins, and more.

      :align: center
      :width: 80%
      :title: Min metrics aggregation
      :alt: Min metrics aggregation

-  **Percentile Ranks**: This is the ranking for values within a given numeric field in percentile. Percentile rank calculates the percentage of values below a specific value in a set and expresses how a given value compares to the distribution of the data.

   Percentile rank aggregation helps in assessing the relative severity of alerts in comparison to the entire dataset. This determines the percentile rank of a specific severity score.

-  **Percentile**: This aggregation changes numeric field values into percentile bands. Percentile identifies specific data values that correspond to specific percentiles. For example, the 90th percentile represents the value below which 90% of the data falls.

      :align: center
      :width: 80%
      :title: Percentiles metrics aggregation
      :alt: Percentiles metrics aggregation

-  **Standard Deviation**: This measures the amount of variation in a set of numeric field values. It evaluates the average distance between each value and the mean value.

   Standard deviation aggregation can help identify changes in event durations. This provides insights into the volatility or stability of security events.

-  **Sum**: This is the total sum of a numeric field. Sum calculates the total sum of a set of values by adding up all the values in the dataset within a selected index pattern.

   Sum aggregation helps in determining the total count of specific event types, the total number of successful logins, the total disk space used, and more.

-  **Top Hit**: This aggregation identifies the top data point based on a specified criteria or sort order. Top hit is commonly used to extract specific information from the dataset based on the top metric.

   Top hit aggregation helps in extracting key information from security events, such as retrieving the most recent log entry for a particular host or user.

      :align: center
      :width: 80%
      :title: Top Hit metrics aggregation
      :alt: Top Hit metrics aggregation

-  **Unique Count**: This is the count of unique values within a designated field. It counts the number of unique or distinct values in a set. Unique count disregards any duplicate event and provides the count of unique values.

   Unique count aggregation helps in determining the number of distinct IP addresses accessing a system, the number of unique users triggering alerts, the count of unique event types, and more.

Parent pipeline aggregations
............................

This category of pipeline aggregations is able to compute new buckets based on other parent aggregations.

   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :title: Parent pipelines aggregation
   :alt: Parent pipelines aggregation

-  **Cumulative Sum**: This is the calculation of the running sum of a metric across a specified set of data points. It shows the progressive total as each data point is added. Cumulative sum aggregation can be used to track the total count of security events over time, providing insights into the cumulative impact of incidents.

-  **Derivative**: This is the calculation of the rate of change of values over time. Derivative is the difference between consecutive values in a time series or dataset. Derivative aggregation helps in calculating the rate of change in event counts or severity scores. This enables the detection of sudden spikes or anomalies.

-  **Moving Avg**: This is the calculation of the average of a metric over a moving window of data points. It provides a neat representation of the data, hence reducing noise or fluctuations. Moving average aggregation helps in smoothing out fluctuations in event counts or resource usage, enabling trend analysis or anomaly detection.

-  **Serial Diff**: This is the difference between consecutive values in a time series or ordered dataset. It measures the absolute change from one data point to the next. Serial diff aggregation helps in identifying the difference in event counts or resource usage between consecutive data points, showing changes or trends.

Sibling pipeline aggregations
.............................

This category of aggregations computes new aggregations which will be at the same level as the sibling aggregation from which its input was provided from.

   :width: 80%
   :title: Sibling pipeline aggregations
   :alt: Sibling pipeline aggregations

-  **Average Bucket**: This is the average value of a metric within each bucket of a specified aggregation. Average bucket provides the average value per group or category. Average bucket aggregation helps in calculating the average severity score or event count within specific time intervals or categories.

-  **Max Bucket**: This is the maximum value of a metric within each bucket of a specified aggregation. It identifies the highest value per group. Max bucket aggregation enables the identification of the maximum severity level or event count within specific time intervals or categories.

-  **Min Bucket**: This is the minimum value of a metric within each bucket of a specified aggregation. It identifies the lowest value per group or category. Min bucket aggregation helps identify the minimum severity level or event count within specific time intervals or categories.

-  **Sum Bucket**: This is the total sum of a metric within each bucket of a specified aggregation. It adds up the values per group. Sum bucket aggregation helps in calculating the total count or severity score within specific time intervals or categories.

Bucket aggregation
''''''''''''''''''

This is used to determine the type of information we are trying to get from the dataset. The bucket aggregation determines how the data is segmented or grouped such as by date. It is typically represented on the X-axis.

.. thumbnail:: /images/wazuh-dashboard/custom-dashboards/bucket-aggregation.png
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :title: Bucket aggregation
   :alt: Bucket aggregation

The following are the types of bucket aggregations:

-  **Date Histogram**: This aggregation is used to display data organized by a date.

-  **Date Range**: This aggregation is used to report the values within a date range which we can specify.

-  **Filters**: This aggregation is used to apply filters on data.

-  **Histogram**: This aggregation is used for numeric fields, where we can provide the integer interval for the selected field.

-  **IPv4 Range**: This aggregation provides us with the option to set the range using IPv4 addresses.

-  **Range**: This aggregation is used to provide the range of numeric field values.

-  **Significant Terms**: This aggregation returns interesting or unusual occurrences of terms in a set.

-  **Terms**: This aggregation enables us to pick the top or bottom n elements of the selected field.

Both the Y-axis and the X-axis are used to plot the data points on a visualization chart.

Basic charts
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following is a list of the basic charts for visualization:

-  **Bar, area, and line charts**: These charts are used for comparing different series in ``x-axis`` and ``y-axis``.
-  **Pie charts**: These charts are used when all of the fields are related to each other.
-  **Heat maps**: These are used to shade the cells within a matrix.

Bar charts
~~~~~~~~~~

Bar charts are a type of visualization that is used to compare specific measures for different data categories. These are the most common types of visualization and are easy to create and interpret. Bar charts are used to present categorical data in the form of rectangular bars with heights/lengths that are proportional to the given values.

Creating a Bar chart
''''''''''''''''''''

**Horizontal Bar**: This is a type of bar chart where rectangular bars are displayed horizontally. The length or width of each bar corresponds to a particular value. This allows an easy comparison between different data points. Horizontal bar charts are often used to visualize data that has distinct categories or to show rankings.

Data metric visualization is a single number that displays any count or calculation.

The following is a list of data visualizations:

-  **Data table**: This is where the data is shown in tabular form.
-  **Metric**: This is where a single number is displayed, which we can use to show any important metric data.
-  **Goal and gauge**: This is used when we want to display any progress.

Data table
~~~~~~~~~~

This is a tabular representation of data that is organized into rows and columns. It provides a structured format to display and analyze data. Each row represents a specific entry, and each column represents a different variable. Data tables are widely used for data analysis, reporting, and providing a clear overview of multiple variables.

The following steps show how to create a Data table to visualize the maximum count of Wazuh rule levels that were triggered.

The following is a list of maps used in visualization:

-  **Coordinate map**: This can be used for linking the aggregation of data fields with geographic locations.
-  **Region map**: This is a kind of thematic map where we use color intensity to show a metric's value with locations.

Coordinate Map
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This uses geographic coordinates to display data points or regions on a map. Coordinate maps allow you to plot and visualize information in relation to specific locations or geographical areas. By using latitude and longitude coordinates, you can represent data in a spatial context.

Coordinate maps are ideal for plotting latitude and longitude coordinates. This allows the visualization of spatial data, such as locations, regions, or density. They are commonly used in geographical analysis, tracking data by location, or displaying demographic information.

The steps below show how to create a coordinate map based on the origin location.
