External API integration
========================

The Wazuh Integrator module allows Wazuh to connect to external APIs and alerting tools such as `Slack`_, `PagerDuty`_, `VirusTotal`_, `Shuffle`_, and `Maltiverse`_. You can also configure the Integrator module to connect to other software. These integrations empower security administrators to enhance orchestration, automate responses, and fortify their defenses against cyber threats.

Configuration
-------------

To configure an integration, add the following configuration within the ``<ossec_config>`` in the ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` file on the Wazuh server:

.. code-block:: xml

   <integration>
     <name> </name>
     <hook_url> </hook_url> <!-- Required for Slack, Shuffle, and Maltiverse -->
     <api_key> </api_key> <!-- Required for PagerDuty, VirusTotal, and Maltiverse -->
     <alert_format>json</alert_format> <!-- Required for Slack, PagerDuty, VirusTotal, Shuffle, and Maltiverse -->

     <!-- Optional filters -->
     <rule_id> </rule_id>
     <level> </level>
     <group> </group>
     <event_location> </event_location>
     <options> </options>
   </integration>

Where:

-  ``<name>`` indicates the name of the service to integrate with. The allowed values are ``slack``, ``pagerduty``, ``virustotal``, ``shuffle``, ``maltiverse``. For custom integrations, the name must be any string that begins with ``custom-``.
-  ``<hook_url>`` is the URL that is used for communication with the software being integrated. It's mandatory for the Slack, Shuffle, and Maltiverse integrations.
-  ``<api_key>`` is the key you would have retrieved from the PagerDuty, VirusTotal, or Maltiverse API. This is mandatory for PagerDuty, VirusTotal, and Maltiverse.
-  ``<alert_format>`` writes the alert file in the JSON format. The Integrator module makes use of this alert file to fetch field values. The allowed value is ``json``.
-  ``<rule_id>`` filters alerts by rule ID. The allowed values are comma-separated rule IDs.
-  ``<level>`` filters alerts by rule level so only alerts with the specified level or above are pushed. The allowed value is any alert level from ``0`` to ``16``.
-  ``<group>`` filters alerts by rule group. For the VirusTotal integration, only rules from the syscheck group are available. The allowed values are any rule group or comma-separated rule groups.
-  ``<event_location>`` filters alerts by where the event originated. The allowed value is any sregex expression.
-  ``<options>`` overwrites the previous fields or adds customization fields according to the information provided in the JSON object. The allowed value is json.

.. note::

   Restart the Wazuh manager when you make any changes to the configuration file. This will ensure that the changes take effect.

Restart the Wazuh manager via the command line interface with the following command:

.. include:: /_templates/common/restart_manager.rst

Optional filters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Wazuh Integrator module uses the optional filters fields to determine which alerts should be sent to the external platforms. Only the alerts that meet the filter conditions are sent. If no filters are specified, all alerts are sent.

The following considerations must be taken into account when the filters are set:

-  It is possible to specify multiple group names using the ``<group>`` tag with a comma-separated list. If the alert's group matches any of the groups in the list, the alert is sent, otherwise, it is ignored.
-  It is possible to specify multiple rule IDs using the ``<rule_id>`` tag with a comma-separated list. The alert is sent if the alert's rule ID matches any of the IDs in the list, otherwise, it is ignored.
-  It is possible to specify the previously described fields together. The alert is sent if both the alert's rule ID and group match any of the IDs and groups in the lists, otherwise, it is ignored.

.. note::

   It is recommended to carefully check the groups and rule identifiers mentioned above, as defining them incorrectly will result in expected alerts not being sent to the integration.

You can find the full configuration options for the Integrator module in the :doc:`integration </user-manual/reference/ossec-conf/integration>` section of the reference guide.

Custom integration
------------------

The Wazuh Integrator module connects Wazuh with other external software. This is achieved by integrating the Wazuh alert system with the APIs of the software products through integration scripts.

Below is an example of a configuration block in the ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` file for custom integration.

.. code-block:: xml

   <!--Custom external Integration -->
   <integration>
     <name>custom-integration</name>
     <hook_url><WEBHOOK></hook_url>
     <level>10</level>
     <group>multiple_drops,authentication_failures</group>
     <api_key><API_KEY></api_key> <!-- Replace with your external service API key -->
     <alert_format>json</alert_format>
    <options>{"data": "Custom data"}</options> <!-- Replace with your custom JSON object -->
   </integration>

Replace:

-  ``<WEBHOOK>`` with the webhook URL of the external application.
-  ``<API_KEY>`` with the API key of the external application.

You can get detailed information on the :doc:`configuration options </user-manual/reference/ossec-conf/integration>` for the Wazuh Integrator module in the reference guide.

Creating an integration script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You are recommended to follow the instructions below when creating an integration script:

#. Create the script in ``/var/ossec/integrations/`` directory on the Wazuh server with the same name indicated in the configuration block.

#. The script  must contain execution permissions and belong to the ``root`` user of the ``wazuh`` group. The commands below assign permissions and ownership to the ``/var/ossec/integrations/custom-script`` script.

   .. code-block:: console

      # chmod 750 /var/ossec/integrations/custom-script
      # chown root:wazuh /var/ossec/integrations/custom-script

#. The first line of the integration script must indicate its interpreter, or else Wazuh won't know how to read and execute the script. The following example line indicates the Python interpreter:

   .. code-block:: python

      #!/usr/bin/env python

#. The script checks the following arguments because it will receive configuration options from them.

   -  The first parameter includes the location of the file that contains the alert. The  parameter is the ``/logs/alerts/alerts.json`` file passed by default in the Wazuh Integrator module:

      .. code-block:: python

         alert_file = open(sys.argv[1])

   -  The second parameter contains the API key which is the ``api_key`` option defined in the ``<integration>`` block:

      .. code-block:: python

         api_key = sys.argv[2]

   -  The third parameter contains the webhook URL which is the ``hook_url`` option defined in the ``<integration>`` block:

      .. code-block:: python

         hook_url = sys.argv[3]

   If none of the above are indicated, the parameters will be received empty.

#. Read the contents of the file indicated in the first parameter and extract, from the alert, the fields that are relevant for the integration. If JSON was used in the ``alert_format`` option, the information has to be loaded as a JSON object.

   .. code-block:: python

      alert_level = alert_json['rule']['level']
      ruleid = alert_json['rule']['id']
      description = alert_json['rule']['description']
      agentid = alert_json['agent']['id']
      agentname = alert_json['agent']['name']
      path = alert_json['syscheck']['path']

We recommend that you check the file ``/logs/alerts/alerts.json`` before starting the development of the integration script to find the format of the alerts to be interpreted.

You can see the example integration script for Jira in the `How to integrate external software using Integrator <https://wazuh.com/blog/how-to-integrate-external-software-using-integrator/>`__ blog post.
