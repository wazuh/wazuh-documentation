Event logging
=============

Logs are raw events received from the Wazuh agents, external APIs, and network devices. The Wazuh server stores all logs indefinitely. To maximize space optimization, the Wazuh manager automatically compresses log files.

Wazuh manages two types of logs, internal logs from the Wazuh server and external logs from monitored endpoints. These logs are stored indefinitely in the ``/var/ossec/logs/`` directory of the Wazuh server.

The table below describes the log files and their storage location on the Wazuh server.

+--------------------------------------------+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Log compression and rotation
----------------------------

Log files can quickly accumulate and consume significant disk space in a system. To prevent this, the Wazuh manager compresses logs during its rotation process, helping to manage disk usage efficiently and maintain system performance. The Wazuh manager compresses log files daily or when they reach a certain threshold (file size, age, time, and more) and archives them. In the log rotation process, Wazuh creates a new log file with the original name to continuously write new events.

Log files are compressed daily and digitally signed using MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 hashing algorithms. The compressed log files are stored in the ``/var/ossec/logs/`` directory within nested directories bearing names with the following format accordingly:

-  The ``log file name``, indicating the name of the original log file.
-  The ``year``, indicating the name of the current year.
-  The ``month``, indicating the name of the current month of the year.

For example, a ``/var/ossec/logs/archives/archives.log`` file compressed on the ``13th APR, 2024`` is stored in the ``…/archives/2024/Apr/`` directory. You can see the contents of directory by executing the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   # ls -la /var/ossec/logs/archives/2024/Apr/

.. code-block:: none
   :class: output

   total 0
   drwxr-x--- 2 wazuh wazuh 62 Apr 17 08:15 .
   drwxr-x--- 4 wazuh wazuh 28 Apr 12 07:30 ..
   -rw-r----- 1 wazuh wazuh  0 Apr 13 00:00 ossec-archive-13.log.gz
   -rw-r----- 1 wazuh wazuh  0 Apr 13 00:00 ossec-archive-13.log.sum

As seen in the output above, the string ``ossec`` and suffix ``day of the current month`` are prepended and appended respectively to the name of the compressed file and its checksum.

Based on your needs, you might configure the compressed files for removal after a specified period. Additionally, you can move them to log management systems, backup servers, or cloud-based storage devices for longer-term retention.

.. _archiving_event_logs:

Archiving event logs
--------------------

Events are logs generated by applications, endpoints, and network devices. The Wazuh server stores all events it receives, whether or not they trigger a rule. These events are stored in the Wazuh archives located at ``/var/ossec/logs/archives/archives.log`` and ``/var/ossec/logs/archives/archives.json``. Security teams use archived logs to review historical data of security incidents, analyze trends, and generate reports to hunt threats.

By default, the Wazuh archives are disabled because it stores logs indefinitely on the Wazuh server. When enabled, the Wazuh manager creates archived files to store and retain security data for compliance and forensic purposes.

.. note::

   The Wazuh archives retain logs collected from all monitored endpoints, therefore consuming significant storage resources on the Wazuh server over time. So, it is important to consider the impact on disk space and performance before enabling them.

Enabling archiving
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Perform the steps below to enable the archiving on your Wazuh server.

#. Edit the Wazuh manager configuration file ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` and set the value of the highlighted fields below to ``yes``:

   .. code-block:: xml

      <ossec_config>
        <global>
          <jsonout_output>yes</jsonout_output>
          <alerts_log>yes</alerts_log>
          <logall>yes</logall>
          <logall_json>yes</logall_json>

         ...
      </ossec_config>

   Where:

   -  ``<logall>`` enables or disables archiving of all log messages. When enabled, the Wazuh server stores the logs in a syslog format. The allowed values are ``yes`` and ``no``.
   -  ``<logall_json>`` enables or disables logging of events. When enabled, the Wazuh server stores the events in a JSON format. The allowed values are ``yes`` and ``no``.

   Depending on the format you desire, you can set one or both values of the highlighted fields to ``yes``. However, only the ``<logall_json>yes</logall_json>`` option allows you to create an index that can be used to visualize the events on the Wazuh dashboard.

#. Restart the Wazuh manager to apply the configuration changes:

   .. code-block:: console

      # systemctl restart wazuh-manager

Depending on your chosen format, the file ``archives.log``, ``archives.json``, or both will be created in the ``/var/ossec/logs/archives/`` directory on the Wazuh server.

Wazuh uses a default log rotation policy. It ensures that available disk space is conserved by rotating and compressing logs on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis.

Visualizing the events on the dashboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Edit the Filebeat configuration file ``/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`` and change the value of ``archives: enabled`` from ``false`` to ``true``:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      archives:
       enabled: true

#. Restart Filebeat to apply the configuration changes:

   .. code-block:: console

      # systemctl restart filebeat

Wazuh dashboard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Click the upper-left menu icon and navigate to **Dashboards management** > **Index patterns** > **Create index pattern**. Use ``wazuh-archives-*`` as the index pattern name, and set ``timestamp`` in the **Time field** drop-down list.

   The GIF below shows how to create the index pattern.

Use case: Detecting signed binary proxy execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Signed binary proxy execution is a technique threat actors use to bypass application whitelisting by using trusted binaries to run malicious code. This technique is identified as ``T1218.010`` based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

In this use case, we show how to abuse the Windows utility, ``regsvr32.exe``, to bypass application controls. We then analyze events in the Wazuh archives to detect suspicious activity related to this technique.

Windows 11 configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Perform the steps below to install Sysmon and Atomic Red Team (ART) on a Windows 11 endpoint and emulate the signed binary proxy execution technique.

Sysmon integration
''''''''''''''''''

Perform the steps below to install and configure Sysmon on the Windows 11 endpoint.

#. Download Sysmon from the `Microsoft Sysinternals page <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon>`__.
#. Download the Sysmon configuration file: `sysmonconfig.xml <https://wazuh.com/resources/blog/detecting-process-injection-with-wazuh/sysmonconfig.xml>`__.
#. Install Sysmon with the downloaded configuration file using PowerShell as an administrator:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      > .\sysmon64.exe -accepteula -i .\sysmonconfig.xml

#. Add the following configuration within the ``<ossec_config>`` block to the Wazuh agent ``C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent\ossec.conf`` file to specify the location to collect Sysmon logs:

   .. code-block:: xml

      <localfile>
        <location>Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational</location>
        <log_format>eventchannel</log_format>
      </localfile>

#. Restart the Wazuh agent to apply the changes by running the following PowerShell command as an administrator:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      > Restart-Service -Name Wazuh

Atomic Red Team installation
............................

Perform the following steps to install the Atomic Red Team PowerShell module on a Windows 11 endpoint using PowerShell as an administrator.

#. By default, PowerShell restricts the execution of running scripts. Run the command below to change the default execution policy to ``RemoteSigned``:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      > Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

#. Install the ART execution framework:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      > IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/invoke-atomicredteam/master/install-atomicredteam.ps1' -UseBasicParsing);
      > Install-AtomicRedTeam -getAtomics

#. Import the ART module to use ``Invoke-AtomicTest`` function:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      > Import-Module "C:\AtomicRedTeam\invoke-atomicredteam\Invoke-AtomicRedTeam.psd1" -Force

#. Use ``Invoke-AtomicTest`` function to show details of the technique ``T1218.010``:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      > Invoke-AtomicTest T1218.010 -ShowDetailsBrief

   .. code-block:: none
      :class: output

      PathToAtomicsFolder = C:\AtomicRedTeam\atomics

      T1218.010-1 Regsvr32 local COM scriptlet execution
      T1218.010-2 Regsvr32 remote COM scriptlet execution
      T1218.010-3 Regsvr32 local DLL execution
      T1218.010-4 Regsvr32 Registering Non DLL
      T1218.010-5 Regsvr32 Silent DLL Install Call DllRegisterServer

Attack emulation
''''''''''''''''

Emulate the signed binary proxy execution technique on the Windows 11 endpoint.

#. Run the command below with Powershell as an administrator to perform the ``T1218.010`` test:

   .. code-block:: powershell

      > Invoke-AtomicTest T1218.010

   .. code-block:: none
      :class: output

      PathToAtomicsFolder = C:\AtomicRedTeam\atomics

      Executing test: T1218.010-1 Regsvr32 local COM scriptlet execution
      Done executing test: T1218.010-1 Regsvr32 local COM scriptlet execution
      Executing test: T1218.010-2 Regsvr32 remote COM scriptlet execution
      Done executing test: T1218.010-2 Regsvr32 remote COM scriptlet execution
      Executing test: T1218.010-3 Regsvr32 local DLL execution
      Done executing test: T1218.010-3 Regsvr32 local DLL execution
      Executing test: T1218.010-4 Regsvr32 Registering Non DLL
      Done executing test: T1218.010-4 Regsvr32 Registering Non DLL
      Executing test: T1218.010-5 Regsvr32 Silent DLL Install Call DllRegisterServer
      Done executing test: T1218.010-5 Regsvr32 Silent DLL Install Call DllRegisterServer

Several calculator instances will pop up after a successful execution of the exploit.

Wazuh dashboard
'''''''''''''''

Use the Wazuh archives to query and display events related to the technique being hunted. It's important to note that while consulting the archives, some events might already be captured as alerts on the Wazuh dashboard. You can use information from the Wazuh archives, including alerts and events that have no detection to create custom rules based on your specific requirements.

#. Apply a time range filter to view events that occurred within the last five minutes of when the test was performed. Filter to view logs from the specific Windows endpoint using ``agent.id``, ``agent.ip`` or ``agent.name``.

   .. thumbnail:: /images/manual/wazuh-server/applying-time-range-filter.png
      :title: Applying time range filter
      :alt: Applying time range filter
      :align: center
      :width: 80%

   There are multiple hits that you can investigate to determine a correlation with the earlier attack emulation. For instance, you may notice a calculator spawning event similar to the one observed on the Windows endpoint during the test.

You can use events from the Wazuh archives to develop detection logic and write custom decoders and rules. You can also use the out-of-the-box ``wazuh-logtest`` tool to test and verify rules against provided logs. For more information, see the :doc:`Custom rules </user-manual/ruleset/rules/custom>`, :doc:`Custom decoders </user-manual/ruleset/decoders/custom>`, and :doc:`wazuh-logtest </user-manual/reference/tools/wazuh-logtest>` documentation.
