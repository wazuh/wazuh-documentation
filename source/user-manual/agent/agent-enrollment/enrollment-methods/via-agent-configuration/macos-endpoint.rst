macOS
=====

Follow these steps to configure a macOS endpoint for enrollment via the Wazuh agent configuration method:

#. Launch the terminal, obtain root access, edit the Wazuh agent configuration file ``/Library/Ossec/etc/ossec.conf``, and make the following changes:

   #. Include the Wazuh manager IP address or FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) in the ``<client><server><address>`` section. Replace ``<WAZUH_MANAGER_IP_ADDRESS>`` with the Wazuh manager IP address or FQDN of the Wazuh manager:

      .. code-block:: xml
         :emphasize-lines: 3

         <client>
           <server>
             <address><WAZUH_MANAGER_IP_ADDRESS></address>
             ...
           </server>
         </client>

      This will allow the Wazuh agent to connect to the Wazuh manager and automatically request a client key.

      .. note::

         If you have a multi-cluster Wazuh server installation, you can add multiple ``<client>`` sections that point to the worker nodes. Refer to :doc:`pointing agents to the cluster (Failover mode) </user-manual/wazuh-server-cluster/agent-connections>` for more information.

   #. (Optional) Add enrollment parameters in the ``<client><enrollment>`` section.

      .. code-block:: xml
         :emphasize-lines: 4,5

         <client>
             ...
             <enrollment>
                 <agent_name>EXAMPLE_NAME</agent_name>
                 <groups>GROUP1,GROUP2,GROUP3</groups>
                 ...
             </enrollment>
         </client>

      These agent enrollment parameters are optional, and they provide the Wazuh agent with specific information that should be used during enrollment. Some common enrollment parameters are below:

      -  ``<agent_name>EXAMPLE_NAME</agent_name>``: This specifies the name the endpoint should be enrolled as. When this is not specified, it defaults to the endpoint hostname.
      -  ``<groups>GROUP1,GROUP2,GROUP3</groups>``: This specifies the group(s) in which the Wazuh agent should be added. An agent group is a collection of agents that would share the same configuration. This allows the Wazuh manager to push configuration settings to a set of Wazuh agents that belong to the same group. The Wazuh agent enrollment will fail if a non-existent group is specified. Therefore, it is necessary to create the desired group on the Wazuh manager before using the group parameter. Additional information on agent groups can be found :doc:`here </user-manual/agent/agent-management/grouping-agents>`.

	   More optional enrollment parameters and their usage are provided :ref:`here <enrollment>`.

#. Restart the Wazuh agent to make the changes effective:

   .. code-block:: console

      # /Library/Ossec/bin/wazuh-control restart

#. Click on the upper-left menu icon and navigate to **Agents management** > **Summary** on the Wazuh dashboard to check for the newly enrolled Wazuh agent and its connection status. If the enrollment was successful, you will have an interface similar to the image below.
