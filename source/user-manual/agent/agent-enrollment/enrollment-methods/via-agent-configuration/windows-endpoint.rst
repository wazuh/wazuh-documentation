Windows
=======

Follow these steps to configure a Windows endpoint for enrollment via the agent configuration method.

The Wazuh agent installation directory depends on the architecture of the endpoint:

-  ``C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent`` for 64-bit systems.
-  ``C:\Program Files\ossec-agent`` for 32-bit systems.

#. Using an administrator account, modify the Wazuh agent configuration file ``ossec.conf`` in the installation directory. For this guide, we are assuming a 64-bit architecture. Hence, ``C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent\ossec.conf``

   -  Include the Wazuh manager IP address or FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) in the ``<client><server><address>`` section. Replace ``<WAZUH_MANAGER_IP_ADDRESS>`` with the Wazuh manager IP address or FQDN:

      .. code-block:: xml
         :emphasize-lines: 3

         <client>
           <server>
             <address><WAZUH_MANAGER_IP_ADDRESS></address>
             ...
           </server>
         </client>

      This will allow the Wazuh agent to connect to the Wazuh manager and automatically request a client key.

      .. note::

         If you have a multi-cluster Wazuh server installation, you can add multiple ``<client>`` sections that point to the worker nodes. Refer to :doc:`pointing agents to the cluster (Failover mode) </user-manual/wazuh-server-cluster/agent-connections>` for more information.

   -  (Optional) Add enrollment parameters in the ``<client><enrollment>`` section.

      .. code-block:: xml
         :emphasize-lines: 4,5

         <client>
             ...
             <enrollment>
                 <agent_name>EXAMPLE_NAME</agent_name>
                 <groups>GROUP1,GROUP2,GROUP3</groups>
                 ...
             </enrollment>
         </client>

      These agent enrollment parameters are optional, and they provide the Wazuh agent with specific information that should be used during enrollment. Some common enrollment parameters are below:

      -  ``<agent_name>EXAMPLE_NAME</agent_name>``: This specifies the name the endpoint should be enrolled as. When this is not specified, it defaults to the endpoint hostname.
      -  ``<groups>GROUP1,GROUP2,GROUP3</groups>``: This specifies the group(s) in which the Wazuh agent should be added. An agent group is a collection of agents that would share the same configuration. This allows the Wazuh manager to push configuration settings to a set of Wazuh agents that belong to the same group. The Wazuh agent enrollment will fail if a non-existent group is specified. Therefore, creating the desired group on the Wazuh manager is necessary before using the group parameter. Additional information on agent groups can be found :doc:`here </user-manual/agent/agent-management/grouping-agents>`.

      More optional enrollment parameters and their usage are provided :ref:`here <enrollment>`.

#. Restart the Wazuh agent to make the changes effective.

   .. tabs::

      .. group-tab:: PowerShell (as an administrator):

         .. code-block:: pwsh-session

            # Restart-Service -Name wazuh

      .. group-tab:: CMD (as an administrator):

         .. code-block:: doscon

            # net stop wazuh
            # net start wazuh

#. Click on the upper-left menu icon and navigate to **Agents management** > **Summary** on the Wazuh dashboard to check for the newly enrolled Wazuh agent and its connection status. If the enrollment was successful, you will have an interface similar to the image below.
