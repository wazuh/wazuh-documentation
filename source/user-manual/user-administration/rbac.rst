Wazuh RBAC - How to create and map internal users
=================================================

Wazuh RBAC allows access to Wazuh resources based on the roles and policies assigned to the users. It is an easy-to-use administration system that enables to manage users' or entities' permissions to the system resources. To learn more, see the :doc:`Role-Based Access Control </user-manual/api/rbac/index>` section. 

The Wazuh platform includes an internal user database that can be used for authentication. It can also be used in addition to an external authentication system such as LDAP or Active Directory.  Learn how to create users and map them with Wazuh in the below sections.

         :title: Wazuh role mapping
         :alt: Wazuh role mapping
         :align: center
         :width: 80%

   #. Click **Create Role mapping** and complete the empty fields with the following parameters:
   
      - **Role mapping name**: Assign a name to the role mapping.
      - **Roles**: Select the Wazuh roles that you want to map the user with.
      - **Internal users**: Select the internal user created previously.

      Wazuh includes an extensive list of :ref:`default policies<api_rbac_reference_default_policies>` and :ref:`roles <api_rbac_reference_default_roles>`. Additionally, you can create custom policies and roles to suit your needs. To see an example, check our :ref:`Use case: Give a user permissions to manage a group of agents <wazuh-rbac-use-case-agents-group>` below. 
  
   #. Click **Save role mapping** to save and map the user with Wazuh.

   For the role mapping to take effect, make sure that ``run_as`` is set to ``true`` in the ``/usr/share/wazuh-dashboard/data/wazuh/config/wazuh.yml`` configuration file. Restart the Wazuh dashboard service and clear your browser cache and cookies.


.. _wazuh-rbac-use-case-agents-group:

Use case: Give a user permissions to read and manage a group of agents
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In this use case, we explore how to create an internal user and give it permissions to read and manage an agents group.

This process involves adding a label in the agent group's centralized configuration to identify the Wazuh alerts coming from this group of agents, creating an internal user, and giving it reading permission only for those documents that correspond to the group of authorized agents.

It also involves mapping this user with the Wazuh API, creating a custom policy that includes permissions to read, restart, upgrade, among other actions over a group of agents, and finally creating a custom role and mapping it to our internal user.

As a final result, we will have a new user with permission to manage a group of agents and read the documents regarding the said group.

In this example, we have an environment with three agents. Agents ``001`` and ``003`` belong to the ``Team_A`` group whereas agents ``002`` and ``003`` belong to the ``Team_B`` group. To learn more about creating agents' groups, see :doc:`Grouping agents </user-manual/agent/agent-management/grouping-agents>`. We will describe how to create a new user and give it permission to manage agents from ``Team_A``.

    :width: 100%


Adding an agents group label
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To prepare the environment, add a label in the ``Team_A`` centralized configuration ``agent.conf``. To learn more, see :doc:`Agent labels </user-manual/agent/agent-management/labels>`.

#. Log into the Wazuh dashboard as administrator.

#. Select **Server management** > **Endpoint Groups** to open the page.

#. Select your group, for example, ``Team_A``.

#. Select **Files** and click **Edit group configuration**. 

#. Add a label to identify the group, for example: 

     .. code-block:: console
  
         <agent_config>
         	<labels>
         		<label key="group">Team_A</label>
         	</labels>
         </agent_config>

#. Click **Save** to complete the action.     

You have now added a group label that allows us to identify all the Wazuh alerts coming from this group of agents. Note that only new alerts will include this group label. 

Creating and mapping an internal user
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Follow these steps to create an internal user, create a custom role and map it to the new user.  

#. Click the upper-left menu icon **☰** to open the available options, go to **Index management** > **Security**, and then **Internal users** to open the internal users' page.

#. Click **Create internal user**, provide a username and password, and click **Create** to complete the action.

#. To create a custom role and map the user to it, follow these steps:
   
   #. Go to **Security**, select **Roles** to open the page.
   #. Click **Create role**, complete the empty fields with the following parameters: 
     
      - **Name**: Assign a name to the role.
       
      - **Cluster permissions**: ``cluster_composite_ops_ro``

      - **Index**: ``*``

      - **Index permissions**: ``read``

   #. Click **Add another index permission** and unfold the new section **Add index permission**. Complete the empty fields with the following parameters and make sure to replace your group name accordingly: 

      - **Index**: ``wazuh-alerts*`` 

      - **Index permissions**: ``read``

      - **Document level security**: 

        .. code-block:: console

          {
            "bool": {
              "must": {
                "match": {
                  "agent.labels.group": "Team_A"
                }
              }
            }
          }

        

   #. Click **Add another index permission** and unfold the new section **Add index permission**. Complete the empty fields with the following parameters and make sure to replace your group name accordingly: 

      - **Index**: ``wazuh-monitoring*`` 

      - **Index permissions**: ``read``

      - **Document level security**: 

        .. code-block:: console
     
          {
            "bool": {
              "must": {
                "match": {
                  "group": "Team_A"
                }
              }
            }
          }          
            

   #. Under **Tenant permissions**, select **Tenant**: ``global_tenant`` and the **Read only** option.
   #. Click **Create** to complete the task.    
   #. Select the **Mapped users** tab and click **Manage mapping**.
   #. Add the user you created in the previous steps and click **Map** to confirm the action.

You have now created an internal user and assigned it reading permissions over the Wazuh alerts and Wazuh monitoring documents from the authorized agents group.
