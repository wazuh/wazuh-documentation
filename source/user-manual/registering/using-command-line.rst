Registering agents using the command line (CLI)
===============================================

This method consists of registering the agents manually in the Wazuh Manager using ``manage_agents`` binary, extracting the key and inserting it in the Wazuh Agents using ``manage_agents`` too. 

This method is completely manual and requires root access (or Administrator access in Windows) to the Wazuh Managers and Wazuh Agents.
