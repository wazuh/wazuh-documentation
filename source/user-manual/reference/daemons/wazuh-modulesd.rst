==============

The wazuh-modulesd program manages the Wazuh modules described below.

.. topic:: Database wodle

  The Wazuh core uses list-based databases to store information related to agent keys, and FIM/Rootcheck event data. This information is highly optimized to be handled by the core.

  In order to provide well-structured data that can be accessed by the user or the Wazuh API, new **SQLite-based databases** have been introduced in the Wazuh manager. The Database Synchronization Module is a **user-transparent component** that collects the following information from the core:

    - Agent information: name, address, encryption key, last connection time, operating system, version, and shared configuration hash.
    - FIM data: creation, modification, and deletion of regular files and Windows registry entries.
    - Rootcheck detected defects: issue message, first detection date, and last alert time.
    - Static core settings: maximum permitted agents or SSL being enabled for Authd.

.. topic:: Command wodle

  The Command module allows running external commands asynchronously, one in each thread.

.. topic:: Syscollector wodle

  The Syscollector module performs periodic scans in the system to obtain information related to the installed hardware, operating system information, network information, installed packages, active ports, and running processes.

.. topic:: AWS S3 wodle

  The AWS S3 wodle allows you to gather and parse logs from multiple AWS services, such as Guard Duty, Macie, VPC Flow, etc. See the :doc:`AWS S3 </cloud-security/amazon/index>` section for more information on this functionality.

.. topic:: GitHub wodle

  The GitHub wodle allows you to gather audit logs from multiple GitHub organizations. See the :doc:`GitHub </cloud-security/github/index>` section for more information on this functionality.

.. topic:: Office 365 wodle

  The Office 365 wodle allows you to gather audit logs from multiple Office 365 organizations. See the :doc:`Office 365 </cloud-security/office365/index>` section for more information on this functionality.

.. topic:: Vulnerability detector wodle

  The Vulnerability Detector module detects applications that are known to be vulnerable (affected by a CVE).

.. topic:: Osquery wodle

  The Osquery wodle provides the user with an operating system instrumentation tool that makes low-level operating system analytics and monitoring both efficient and intuitive using SQL-based queries. For more information, read through the documentation for :doc:`osquery integration </user-manual/capabilities/system-inventory/osquery>`.

.. topic:: SCA module

  The :ref:`SCA module <manual_sec_config_assessment>` allows users to check the system configuration against policy files to determine vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

.. topic:: Agent upgrade module

  The agent upgrade module manages, validates, executes, and checks the result of all the agent upgrade requests. It uses the WPK files.

.. topic:: Task manager module

  The task manager module creates, updates, and manages all the tasks performed on the agents.
