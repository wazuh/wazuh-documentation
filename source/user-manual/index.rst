User manual
================

Welcome to the Wazuh user manual. Use it as your Wazuh reference library once you have a basic Wazuh installation in place. In the same way that the main components of Wazuh are a fork of the renowned OSSEC HIDS project, so this user manual has been derived from the `OSSEC documentation <http://ossec.github.io/docs/>`_. Kudos to the OSSEC team for their huge contribution to the IT security community.
