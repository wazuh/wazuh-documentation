Discover
==========

The Discover tab will show you a discovering interface similar to the Kibana itself Discover tab. The main difference is 
we are using your selected index pattern, this way you don't need to take care about index patterns neither go to the Kiabana advanced
settings to properly create or select an index pattern.
