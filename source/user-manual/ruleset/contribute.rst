Contribute to the ruleset
===========================

If you have created new rules, decoders or rootchecks and you would like to contribute to our repository, please fork our `Github repository <https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-ruleset>`_ and submit a pull request.

If you are not familiar with Github, you can also share them through our `mailing list <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/wazuh>`_, to which you can subscribe by sending an email to ``wazuh+subscribe@googlegroups.com``. Also, do not hesitate to request new rules or rootchecks that you would like to see running in Wazuh.  Our team will do our best to make it happen.

.. note::
  In our repository you will find that most of the rules contain one or more groups called pci_dss_X. This is the PCI DSS control related to the rule. We have produced a document that can help you tag each rule with its corresponding PCI requirement: `PCI tagging <http://www.wazuh.com/resources/PCI_Tagging.pdf>`_
