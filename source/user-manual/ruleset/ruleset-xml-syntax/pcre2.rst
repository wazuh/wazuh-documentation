Perl-compatible Regular Expressions
===================================

Incorporation of PCRE regex support along with already existing OSRegex and OSMatch regex open up a range of possibilities, and enhance log comprehension and interpretation.

This section briefly describes the features of this type of regex, its enablement in rules, decoders, and some use cases applied to the default ruleset.

Advantages
----------

Quantifiers
^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the already known ``*`` and ``+`` quantifiers, PCRE incorporates:

-  ``?`` try to match zero or one time. Example: ``https?`` regex will match http and https.
-  ``{n}`` try to match exactly n times. Example: ``\d{4}`` regex matches exactly four consecutive digits in a string.
-  ``{n,}`` try to match n or more times. Example: ``\d{2,}`` will be 12, 123, 1234 and so on.
-  ``{n,m}`` try to match between n and m times. Example: ``\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}`` will match any IPv4 address.

All quantifiers can be used and combined with groups, expressions and literals. Example: ``(\d{1,3}\.?){4}`` is shorter than and equivalent to ``\d{1,3}\.?\d{1,3}\.?\d{1,3}\.?\d{1,3}.?``.

Case sensitivity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Compared to :ref:`OSRegex <os_regex_syntax>` and :ref:`OSMatch <sregex_os_match_syntax>`, which are case insensitive, PCRE regex are case sensitive by default. This can be changed by using ``(?i)``. Example: ``post`` will match ``(?i)POST|GET|PUT`` regex but not ``POST|GET|PUT``.

Groups within groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PCRE provides ease and flexibility in data extraction. Unlike :ref:`OSRegex <os_regex_syntax>`, it allows groups within groups. For example, in the next log, the regular expression ``from=<(.*?@(.*?))>`` extracts the email (john@email-dom.com) and domain (email-dom.com) into separate fields.

.. code-block:: none

   Sep 29 17:11:02 ramp sendmail[21549]: v8TLB2x7021549: from=<john@email-dom.com>, size=909, class=0, nrcpts=1, msgid=<201709292111.v8TLB1Nj021545@email.com>, proto=ESMTP, daemon=MTA, relay=[2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334]

Groups comparing: backreferences
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Backreferences match the same text as previously matched by a capturing group. Groups can be referenced in the order they are declared with a backslash followed by the group number. For example, in the next log, the regular expression ``^(\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+) \1`` only matches if both IP addresses at the beginning of the log are equal.

.. code-block:: none

   10.10.10.11 10.10.10.11 - - [10/Apr/2017:13:18:05 -0700] "GET /injection/%0d%0aSet-Cookie HTTP/1.1" 404 271 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:22.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/22.0"

Character classes (character set)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the types of characters like ``\w`` to match a word character or ``\d`` to match the decimal digit, a custom set of characters can be specified with ``[]``. Ranges of letters and numbers can also be specified. For example, ``[A-zA-Z0-5]`` includes the numbers from 0 to 5 and the entire alphabet in upper and lower case letters. Example: The next regex ``\d+[-\/]\d+[-\/]\d+`` will match any datetime despite the separation character used.

Configuring PCRE
----------------

PCRE can be enabled in rules and decoders using the ``type="pcre2"`` attribute, which also allow to set other regex like ``type="osregex"`` and ``type="osmatch"`` for :ref:`OSRegex <os_regex_syntax>` and :ref:`OSMatch <sregex_os_match_syntax>`, respectively, depending on the case.

Decoders
^^^^^^^^

You can enable PCRE in the following decoder options: :ref:`program_name <decoders_program_name>`, :ref:`prematch <decoders_prematch>`, and :ref:`regex <decoders_regex>`.

Below is a simple example of data extraction with PCRE. Here is a log message of a program called ``example_pcre2``:

.. code-block:: none

   Dec 25 20:45:02 MyHost example_pcre2[12345]: User 'admin' change email to 'admin@suspicious-domain.com'

You can use PCRE in a decoder to extract the user, email, and domain from the log:

.. code-block:: xml

   <decoder name="example_pcre2">
         <program_name>^example_pcre2$</program_name>
   </decoder>

   <decoder name="example_pcre2">
         <parent>example_pcre2</parent>
         <regex type="pcre2">User '(.*?)' change email to '(.*?@(.*?))'</regex>
         <order>user, email, domain</order>
   </decoder>

Rules
^^^^^

In rules, you can enable and use PCRE along with :ref:`OSRegex <os_regex_syntax>`, :ref:`OSMatch <sregex_os_match_syntax>` regular expressions.

The following rules options are compatible with PCRE:

-  For matching static fields: :ref:`action <rules_action>`, :ref:`extra_data <rules_extra_data>`, :ref:`hostname <rules_hostname>`, :ref:`id <rules_id>`, :ref:`location <rules_location>`, :ref:`match <rules_match>`, :ref:`program_name <rules_prog_name>`, :ref:`protocol <rules_protocol>`, :ref:`user <rules_user>`, :ref:`url <rules_url>`, :ref:`srcport <rules_srcport>`, :ref:`dstport <rules_dstport>`, :ref:`status <rules_status>`, :ref:`system_name <rules_sys_name>`, :ref:`dstgeoip <rules_dstgeoip>`, :ref:`srcgeoip <rules_srcgeoip>`.
-  For matching dynamic fields: :ref:`field <rules_field>`.

Below is an example of data extraction with PCRE regex in a rule:

.. code-block:: none

   May  12 11:07:21 web passwd[21533]: pam_unix(passwd:chautok]: password changed for foo

We use PCRE to match on which host a password change is made using the hostname in the rule below.

.. code-block:: xml

   <group name="sshd,">
     <rule id="100101" level="5">
       <if_sid>5555</if_sid>
       <hostname type="pcre2">web</hostname>
       <description>Password changed on $(hostname).</description>
     </rule>
   </group>

Use case: Accurate PAM user alerts
----------------------------------

**The Linux Pluggable Authentication Modules(PAM)** is a key component that brings authentication support for applications and services in UNIX-like systems, most of which are case sensitive. By default, some false positive alerts related to usernames may be generated. For example, users FOO and foo are not differentiated by the rules. This can be avoided by using PCRE case sensitivity, so they are handled as different users. The next custom rule generates an alert when the  foo user logs into the system via SSH.

.. code-block:: xml

   <group name="sshd,">
     <rule id="100002" level="5">
       <if_sid>5501</if_sid>
       <description>foo user logged in.</description>
       <user type="pcre2">foo</user>
     </rule>
   </group>

The ``/var/ossec/bin/wazuh-logtest`` output shows the triggered alert.

.. code-block:: none
