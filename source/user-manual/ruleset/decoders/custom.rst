Custom decoders
===============

You can customize the Wazuh decoders on the Wazuh server to suit your requirements and improve your detection capabilities. Wazuh allows you to:

Add custom decoders
-------------------

.. note::
   
   Add your new decoders in the ``/var/ossec/etc/decoders/local_decoder.xml`` file. We recommend creating new decoder files in the ``/var/ossec/etc/decoders/`` directory for changes on a larger scale.

Check out this example on how to create new decoders and rules. The following log corresponds to a program called ``example``:

.. code-block:: none

   Dec 25 20:45:02 MyHost example[12345]: User 'admin' logged from '192.168.1.100'

#. Add a new decoder to ``/var/ossec/etc/decoders/local_decoder.xml`` to decode the log information:

   .. code-block:: xml

      <decoder name="example">
        <program_name>^example</program_name>
      </decoder>

      <decoder name="example">
        <parent>example</parent>
        <regex>User '(\w+)' logged from '(\d+.\d+.\d+.\d+)'</regex>
        <order>user, srcip</order>
      </decoder>

#. Run ``/var/ossec/bin/wazuh-logtest`` utility on the Wazuh server and enter the example log above to test the decoder and rule:

   .. code-block:: none

      Type one log per line

      Dec 25 20:45:02 MyHost example[12345]: User 'admin' logged from '192.168.1.100'

      **Phase 1: Completed pre-decoding.
              full event: 'Dec 25 20:45:02 MyHost example[12345]: User 'admin' logged from '192.168.1.100''
              timestamp: 'Dec 25 20:45:02'
              hostname: 'MyHost'
              program_name: 'example'

      **Phase 2: Completed decoding.
              name: 'example'
              dstuser: 'admin'
              srcip: '192.168.1.100'

   To test your rules and decoders using the ``/var/ossec/bin/wazuh-logtest`` utility, simply save the changes made to the decoder and rule files. However, you need to restart the Wazuh manager to generate alerts based on these modifications.

#. Restart the Wazuh manager to apply the changes:

   .. include:: /_templates/installations/manager/restart_wazuh_manager.rst

Modify default decoders
-----------------------

Default decoders may not parse custom or non-standard log formats correctly, so modifying them ensures accurate analysis for your specific environment.

To modify a default decoder, you can rewrite its file in the ``/var/ossec/etc/decoders/`` directory on the Wazuh server, make the changes, and exclude the original decoder file from the loading list. This approach avoids editing core files, preventing conflicts during Wazuh updates, and allows tailored log processing to extract specific fields or handle unique application logs effectively.

For example, if you want to customize decoders in the ``/var/ossec/ruleset/decoders/0310-ssh_decoders.xml`` file, follow these steps:

#. Copy the decoder file ``/var/ossec/ruleset/decoders/0310-ssh_decoders.xml`` to the user directory ``/var/ossec/etc/decoders/``. This ensures that your changes are saved when upgrading to a newer version.
#. Edit the Wazuh server ``/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`` configuration file. Set the ``<decoder_exclude>`` tag to exclude the original ``/var/ossec/ruleset/decoders/0310-ssh_decoders.xml`` decoder file from the loading list. With this configuration, Wazuh loads the decoder file located in the ``/var/ossec/etc/decoders/`` user directory instead of the file in the default directory.

   .. code-block:: xml
      :emphasize-lines: 11

      <ruleset>
        <!-- Default ruleset -->
        <decoder_dir>ruleset/decoders</decoder_dir>
        <rule_dir>ruleset/rules</rule_dir>
        <rule_exclude>0215-policy_rules.xml</rule_exclude>
        <list>etc/lists/audit-keys</list>

        <!-- User-defined ruleset -->
        <decoder_dir>etc/decoders</decoder_dir>
        <rule_dir>etc/rules</rule_dir>
        <decoder_exclude>ruleset/decoders/0310-ssh_decoders.xml</decoder_exclude>
      </ruleset>

#. Make the changes into the ``/var/ossec/etc/decoders/0310-ssh_decoders.xml`` file.
#. Restart the Wazuh manager to apply the changes:

   .. include:: /_templates/installations/manager/restart_wazuh_manager.rst

.. warning::
   
   By excluding the original decoder file, you won't receive the updates it may receive. Your custom file will remain unchanged during upgrades. So, consider applying relevant changes manually.
