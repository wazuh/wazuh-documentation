Wazuh Amazon AWS guide
======================

This section provides instructions to integrate OSSEC with Amazon AWS. It also explains different use cases as examples on how the rules, developed by Wazuh, can be used to alert on specific events. In `our github repository <http://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-ruleset/>`_ there are rules for IAM, EC2 and VPC services.

The diagram below explains how a log message, generated by an AWS event, flows until it arrives to the OSSEC agent. Once the agent reads the message, it sends it to the OSSEC manager which performs the analysis using the rules. When a rule matches, an alert is triggered (if the level is high enough).

1. CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your account and delivers log files. Meaning that, when an AWS event occurs, Cloudtrail generates the log message. Using CloudTrail we can get more visibility into AWS user activity, tracking changes made to AWS resources.
2. Once an event takes place, CloudTrail delivers the log message to Amazon S3, writing it to a log file. S3 allows log files to be stored durably and inexpensively.
3. The script ``getawslog.py`` downloads the logs files from ``Amazon S3`` into the OSSEC agent, uncompressing them and appending new data to a local plain text file.

This diagram makes it easier to understand the integration process described below.

Wazuh integration with Amazon AWS
---------------------------------

Prior to the installation of the OSSEC rules for Amazon AWS, follow the steps below in order to enable AWS API to generate log messages and store them as JSON data files in Amazon S3 Bucket. A detailed description of each of the steps can be found further below.

1. Turn on CloudTrail.
2. Create a user with permission to access S3.
3. Install Python Boto in your Ossec Agent.
4. Configure the previous user credentials with AWS Cli in your Ossec Agent.
5. Run the script getawslog.py to download the log JSON files and convert them into flat files.
6. Install Wazuh Amazon rules.

Turn on CloudTrail
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a trail for your AWS account. Trails can be created using the AWS CloudTrail console or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). Both methods follow the same steps. In this case we will be focusing on the first one:

* Turn on ``CloudTrail``. Note that, by default, when creating a trail in one region in the CloudTrail console, this one will apply to all regions.

.. warning:: Please do not enable `Enable log file validation` parameter, it's not supported by provided python script.

* Create a new Amazon S3 bucket or specify an existing bucket to store all your log files. By default, log files from all AWS regions in your account will be stored in the bucket selected.

.. note:: When naming a new bucket, if you get this error ``Bucket already exists. Select a different bucket name.``, then try a different name, since the one you have selected is already in use by other Amazon AWS user.

From now on, all the events in your Amazon AWS account will be logged. You can search log messages manually inside ``CloudTrail/API activity history``. Note that every 7 min a JSON file containing new log messages will be stored in your bucket.

Create a user with permission to access S3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sign in to the ``AWS Management Console`` and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
In the navigation panel, choose ``Users`` and then choose ``Create New Users``.
Type the user names for the users you would like to create.

.. note:: User names can only use a combination of alphanumeric characters and these characters: plus (+), equal (=), comma (,), period (.), at (@), and hyphen (-). Names must be unique within an account.

The users require access to the API. For this, they must have access keys. To generate access key for new users, select ``Generate an access key`` for each user and ``Choose Create``.

.. warning:: This is your only opportunity to view or download the secret access keys, and you must provide this information to your users before they can use the AWS Console. If you don't download and save them now, you will need to create new access keys for the users later. You will not have access to the secret access keys again after this step.

Give the user(s) access to this specific S3 bucket (based on http://blogs.aws.amazon.com/security/post/Tx3VRSWZ6B3SHAV/Writing-IAM-Policies-How-to-grant-access-to-an-Amazon-S3-bucket)

Under the IAM console, select ``Users`` and go to the ``Permissions`` tab, in the ``Inline Policies`` section, select the ``Create User Policy`` button. Click the ``Custom Policy`` option and push the ``Select`` button.


In the next page enter some ``Policy Name`` e.g. ossec-cloudtrail-s3-access and for ``Policy Document`` use the example provided below:

::

  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": ["s3:ListBucket"],
        "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::YOURBUCKETNAME"]
      },
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
          "s3:GetObject",
          "s3:DeleteObject"
        ],
        "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::YOURBUCKETNAME/*"]
      }
    ]
  }

Install Python Boto in your Ossec Agent
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To download and process the Amazon AWS logs that already are archived in S3 Bucket we need to install Python Boto in the OSSEC agent and configure it to enable the connection with AWS S3.

Prerequisites for Python Boto installation using Pip

* Windows, Linux, OS X, or Unix
* Python 2 version 2.7+ or Python 3 version 3.3+
* Pip

Check if Python is already installed: ::

  $ python --version

If Python 2.7 or later is not installed then, install it with your distribution's package manager as shown below:

* On Debian derivatives such as Ubuntu, use APT: ::

  $ sudo apt-get install python2.7

* On Red Hat and derivatives, use yum: ::

  $ sudo yum install python27

Open a command prompt or shell and run the following command to verify that Python has been installed correctly: ::

  $ python --version
  Python 2.7.9

To install pip on Linux

* Download the installation script from pypa.io: ::

  $ curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

* Run the script with Python: ::

  $ sudo python get-pip.py

Now that Python and pip are installed, use pip to install boto: ::

  $ sudo pip install boto


Configure user credentials with Python Boto
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To configure the user credentials you need to create a file called ``/etc/boto.cfg`` looking like: ::

  [Credentials]
  aws_access_key_id = <your_access_key_here>
  aws_secret_access_key = <your_secret_key_here>

Run the python script to download the JSON data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We use a python script to download JSON files from S3 Bucket and convert them into flat files that can be used with Ossec. This script was written by Xavier Martens @xme and contains minor modifications done by Wazuh. It is located in our repository at ``wazuh/ossec-rules/tools/amazon/getawslog.py``.

Run the following command to use this script: ::

  $ ./getawslog.py -b s3bucketname -d -j -D -l /path-with-write-permission/amazon.log

Where ``s3bucketname`` is the name of the bucket created when CloudTrail was activated (see the first step in this section: "Turn on CloudTrail") and ``/path-with-write-permission/amazon.log`` is the path where the log flat file is stored once has been converted by the script.

.. note:: In case you don't want to use an existing folder, create it manually before running the script.

CloudTrail delivers log files to your S3 bucket approximately every 7 minutes. Run the script adding a crontab job and note that running it more frequently than once every 7 minutes would be useless. CloudTrail does not deliver log files if no API calls are made on your account.

Run ``crontab -e`` and, at the end of the file, add the following line ::

  */5 *   * * * /usr/bin/flock -n /tmp/cron.lock -c python path_to_script/getawslog.py -b s3bucketname -d -j -D -l /path-with-write-permission/amazon.log


.. note:: This script downloads and deletes the files from your S3 Bucket. However, you can always review the log messages generated during the last 7 days through CloudTrail.

Install Wazuh Amazon rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To install Wazuh Amazon rules follow either the `Automatic installation <http://documentation.wazuh.com/en/latest/ossec_ruleset.html#automatic-installation>`_ section or `Manual installation <http://documentation.wazuh.com/en/latest/ossec_ruleset.html#manual-installation>`_ section in this guide.

Use Cases
---------

Our Rules focuses on providing the desired visibility within the Amazon AWS platform.

The following describes some use cases for IAM, EC2 and VPC services. The structure followed is always the same. You will see the definition of the rule that matches with the log message generated by the AWS event. You can check how this log message flows in the diagram at the beginning of this section. Also, in each of the examples, you will see a screenshot of how Kibana shows the corresponding alert. Remember that an alert is triggered when the log message matches a specific rule if its level is high enough.

Iam Use cases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to securely control access to AWS services and resources for your users. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.

To follow find some use cases when using some of the Wazuh rules built for IAM.

Create user account
+++++++++++++++++++

When we create a new user account in IAM, an AWS event is generated. As per the diagram at the beginning of this section, the log message flows until the OSSEC agent gets the log file and sends it to the OSSEC manager. The latter analyze the log file and finds that the log message generated by this event matches the rule with id number 880861. Due to this match, an alert is generated and Kibana will show it as seen below.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|**Definition of rule 80861**                                          |

|                                                                      |
|  <rule id="80861" level="2">                                         |

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Create user account without permissions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If the user that is creating a new user account doesn't have permissions to create new users, then the log message generated will match the ``rule id 80862`` and Kibana will show the alert as follows:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|**Definition of rule 80862**                                          |

User login failed
+++++++++++++++++

When a user try to log in introducing an invalid password, a new event, and therefore a new log message will be generated. This log message, once is analyzed by the OSSEC manager, will match the ``rule id 80802``, generating an alert that will be shown in Kibana as follows:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|**Definition of rule 80802**                                                     |

EC2 Use cases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.

Amazon EC2's simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon's proven computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change. Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use. Amazon EC2 provides developers the tools to build failure resilient applications and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.

To follow find some use cases when using some of the Wazuh rules built for EC2.

Run a new instance in EC2
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

When a user runs a new instance in EC2, an AWS event is generated. As per the diagram at the beginning of this section, the log message flows until the OSSEC agent gets the log file and sends it to the OSSEC manager. The latter analyzes the log file and finds that the log message generated by this event which matches the rule with id number 80301. Due to this match, an alert is generated and Kibana will show it as seen below:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|**Definition of rule 80301**                                          |

Contribute to the ruleset
-------------------------

If you have created new rules, decoders or rootchecks and you would like to contribute to our repository, please fork our `Github repository <https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-ruleset>`_ and submit a pull request.

If you are not familiar with Github, you can also share them through our `users mailing list <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/wazuh>`_, to which you can subscribe by sending an email to ``wazuh+subscribe@googlegroups.com``. As well, do not hesitate to request new rules or rootchecks that you would like to see running in OSSEC and our team will do our best to make it happen.

.. note:: In our repository you will find that most of the rules contain one or more groups called pci_dss_X. This is the PCI DSS control related to the rule. We have produced a document that can help you tag each rule with its corresponding PCI requirement: http://www.wazuh.com/resources/PCI_Tagging.pdf

What's next
-----------

Once you have your rules for Amazon AWS up to date we encourage you to move forward and try out ELK integration or the API RESTful, check them on:
