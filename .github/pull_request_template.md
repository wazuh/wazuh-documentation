## Community contributions advice

We love our community contributions. First, we work with the numbered branches. The `master` branch is only updated when a new Wazuh release is done. We recommend making PRs from the actual branch. For instance, if Wazuh 3.11.4 is the latest release, the branch to be used is 3.11.

Anyway, if you contribute from the master branch, we will `cherry-pick` your commits to the numerated branch for you. 

Thanks!
